Q2You are managing a project that is overseeing the installation of a golf simulator at the local golf club. The project has been scheduled to take eight weeks. The total cost of the project is set at $78,000. At the five week mark of the project, it has been determined that the project is 1.5 weeks behind schedule, and the cost so far is $45,000. Which option represents the cost variance of this project?

A. -$14,625
B. -$10 875
C. $3,750
D. $10,875
Correct Answer: B
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The cost variance (CV) is the difference in what was expected to be spent and what was actually spent. To calculate the CV, the earned value (EV) must first be calculated. This is done by using the formula EV = Actual % Complete * budget at completion (BAC).
First, you calculate the Actual % Complete by dividing 3.5 by 8 (3.5 / 8 = 0.4375). You do this because the project is at the five week mark, and it is 1.5 weeks behind schedule (5-1.5 = 3.5). This gives an Actual % Complete of 43.75%. You then multiply this by the BAC ($78,000), to get an EV of $34,125 (0.4375 * $78,000 = $34,125).
The CV is then calculated by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the EV:
CV= EV-AC
So in this case, CV = $34,125- $45,000 = -$10,875. The AC is calculated simply by adding up all the money spent so far in the project, which in this scenario is $45,000.

A. -$25,510
B. $683,850
C. $25,510
D. -$8,950
Correct Answer: A
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The current projected variance at completion (VAC) for this project is -$25,510. For more information on how VAC was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
Calculation Explanation
VAC is calculated using the following formula:
VAC = BAC - EAC
In this case, you know the BAC ($1,250,000), but you do not know the EAC. The proper way to calculate the EAC in this scenario is by using the following formula: EAC = BAC / cumulative CPI. Therefore, you must first calculate the cumulative CPI.
To calculate the cumulative CPI, you have to add up the earned values (EVs) and you have to add up the actual costs (ACs) for all months up to the point at which you need to calculate the cumulative CPI.
The cumulative EV is $57,000 + $187,100 + $149,500 + $161,800 = $555,400. The cumulative AC is $49,000 + $178,500 + $167,900 + $170,750 = $566,150.
You then need to divide the cumulative EV by the cumulative AC ($555,400 / $566,150 = 0.98) to get the cumulative CPI of 0.98.
Once you have the cumulative CPI, you can then calculate the EAC. This will work out to an EAC of $1,250,000 /0.98 = $1,275,510.
Then once the EAC is subtracted from the BAC, you can determine the VAC:
VAC = $1,250,000 - $1,275,510 = -$25,510

Project A has an NPV of $30,000
Project B has an NPV of $55,000

A. $55,000
B. $30,000
C. $25,000
D. $85,000
Correct Answer: B
Section: Initiation
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
NPV is calculated by taking the total expected revenue and subtracting the estimated cost over the life of the project. A project that has a positive NPV would be considered a good investment; and the higher the NPV, the more attractive the option. Since project B has the greatest positive NPV, it should be chosen.
Opportunity cost is the cost of the opportunity that you give up when you select one project over another one. In this case, we would select project B because it has the higher NPV value. Therefore, the opportunity cost would be the cost of project A, which is $30,000.

Refer to the contract outline for the details.
Contract Outline
Description Value
Target Cost: $2,000,000,000
Target Profit: $200,000,000
Target Price: $2,200,000,000
Ceiling Price: $2,450,000,000
Share Ratio: 80% Buyer, 20% Seller

B. Cost-plus-incentive-fee, and a PTA of $2,450,000
C. Cost-plus-incentive-fee, and a PTA of $1,960,000,000
D. Fixed-price-plus-incentive-fee, and a PTA of $2,312,500,000 Correct Answer: D
Section: Planning
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A fixed-price-plus-incentive-fee contract would best suit the needs of this scenario, and the Point of Total Assumption (PTA) is $2,312,500,000. A fixed-price contract transfers most of the risk to the seller. This is because the buyer and seller agree up-front on a fixed fee. If the seller incurs overruns during the course of fulfilling the contract, they bear the associated costs. The added component of incentive in the fixed-price- plus-incentive contract will reward the seller for efficiently producing the helicopters.
Review the following information for details on calculating the PTA for this scenario.
Calculating the PTA
The fixed-price-plus-incentive-fee contract type offers the contractor more profit if costs are reduced, or if performance is improved. Alternatively, the contractor obtains less profit if performance does not meet goals, or if costs are higher. With this contract type, the incentives are normally shared according to a ratio.
In this scenario there is an 80/20 share ratio, so your organization pays 80 cents and the contracting company pays 20 cents of each dollar above target cost.
The scenario presents a target cost, target profit, and a ceiling price. The ceiling price represents the maximum amount that the contractor will be paid. If the contractor performs the project at a cost under the target cost, they will receive the full amount of the targeted profit plus a 20 percent share of the cost under runs. If the costs exceed the target cost, then the contractor will pay 20 percent of the overrun out of their profits. In this type of contract there is also a PTA, in which all additional costs will be the contractor's responsibility.
The calculation for the PTA is as follows:
PTA = ((Ceiling Price -- Target Price) / Buyer Percentage) + Target Cost PTA = (($2,450,000,000 - $2,200,000,000) / 0.80) + $2,000,000,000 PTA = ($250,000,000 / 0.80) + $2,000,000,000
PTA = $312,500,000 + $2,000,000,000
PTA = $2,312,500,000
The PTA is the point at which cost increases that exceed the target cost are no longer shared by the buyer based on the agreed share ratio. This is the point above which the contractor's profit is reduced by one dollar for every additional dollar of cost.
If a share ratio element did not exist in the contract, the ceiling price would be the PTA. The Fixed-Price- Plus-Incentive-Fee contract includes a sharing ratio, which modifies the PTA value.

A. Duration = 5, LS = 18
B. Duration = 4, LS = 18
C. Duration = 4, LS = 19
D. Duration = 5, LS = 19
Correct Answer: A
Section: Planning
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The late start (LS) date for an activity can be calculated by adding the free float for the activity to the early start (ES) date. The formula would be LS = Float+ ES. When applied to the formula, the result is as follows:
LS = Float + ES
LS = 3 + 15
LS = 18
Since the first task starts on day 1, the duration can be calculated by subtracting the ES date from the early finish (EF) date and adding 1. The formula would be Duration = EF - ES + 1. When applied to the formula, the result is as follows:
Duration = EF  ES + 1
Duration = 19 - 15 + 1
Duration = 5

How much free float is associated with Activity B?

A. 2
B. 5
C. 3
D. 4
Correct Answer: C
Section: Planning
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The free float for Activity B is the duration it can be delayed before it delays the start for Activity C. The formula used to calculate the free float for an activity is the early start (ES) date of the successor activity minus the early finish (EF) date of the current activity minus 1 (Free Float = ES - EF - 1) when the first day of the project begins on day 1. Therefore, the following calculation is used Free Float = 6  2 - 1
Free Float = 3

Q170You are a procurement specialist preparing a contract for a software development project. Through negotiations, it has been determined that a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract type will be used. The following criteria for the contract have been agreed upon:
Target Project Cost: $200,000
Fee to the Seller $30,000
Share Ratio: 80% Buyer, 20% Seller
Which final payout is appropriate if the project costs $220,000 to perform the work outlined in the contract?

A. $26.000
B. $246.000
C. $214.000
D. $34,000
Correct Answer: B
Section: Planning
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The formula used to calculate the final payout is Target cost + Fixed fee + Buyer share ratio * (Actual Cost - Target Cost).
If the final costs are $220,000, the Buyer will pay 200,000 + 30,000 + 0.8 * (220,000 - 200,000) = $246,000.
In this scenario, the seller earns $26,000, which is less than if the target cost was not exceeded. $246,000 (final payout) - $220,000 (actual cost) = $26,000 profit. In this case, the incentive is a negative value of -$4,000 that comes off the predetermined fee of $30,000 that was agreed upon.

Q177You are planning the procurement of some widgets that will be needed for a project that you are managing. You need to ensure that any contract-related risk falls on the seller. Which contract type will meet your needs?

A. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract
B. A fixed-price with economic price adjustment contract
C. A firm fixed-price contract
D. A cost-plus-incentive-fee contract
Correct Answer: C
Section: Planning
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

With a fixed-price contract, the buyer pays an agreed price. Firm fixed-price contracts are the simplest and most common. The seller offers a product or service at a price and the buyer agrees to pay the price. A seller's profits are equal to this fixed price minus any costs. So a seller bound by a firm fixed-price contract is vulnerable to changing market forces. With a firm fixed-price contract, the seller carries all the risk.

Q179You are managing a project that involves installing a new generator in the local power station. The project has been scheduled to take five weeks. The total cost of the project is set at $780.000. At the three week mark of the project, it has been determined that the project is one week behind schedule, and the cost so far is $390.000. Which option represents the schedule performance index of this project?

A. 1.5
B. 0.67
C. 0.8
D. 1.2
Correct Answer: B
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The schedule performance index (SPI) is calculated by dividing the earned value (EV) by the planned value (PV), or SPI = EV / PV. For more information on how the SPI was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
Calculation Explanation
SPI is calculated using the following formula.
SPI = EV/PV
Since the example does not provide the EV or the PV, they must first be calculated.
The EV is calculated using the following formula: EV = Actual % Complete * budget at completion (BAC).
First, you calculate the Actual % Complete by dividing 2 by 5. You use 2 because although the planned work is at week three, the actual project work is one week behind. This must be taken into consideration.
This gives an Actual % Complete of 40% (2/5 = 0.4). You then multiply this with the BAC to get an EV of 0.4
* $780,000 = $312,000.
Next, you calculate the PV using the following formula: PV = Planned % Complete * BAC. First, you need to calculate the Planned % Complete by dividing the planned point in the schedule (three weeks) by the total number of weeks in the project (five weeks). This will result in 60% (3/5 = 0.6). The Planned% Complete is then multiplied with the BAC, which results in a PV of 0.6 * $780,000 = $468,000.
Now that you have the EV and the PV, you can apply them to the original formula to obtain the SPI:
SPI = $312,000 / $468,000 = 0.67

When situations such as personally receiving gifts from a customer (an example of personal gain) arise, you need to consider if there are any legal issues. You also need to consider whether the behavior is unethical in any way, and whether company policy will be broken. If any of these conditions are met, the correct decision is to not accept the gift. In this scenario, there are no laws preventing you from accepting the gift. It is clearly not a bribe, and the behavior is not unethical based on the country's customs. However, the scenario does state that it is against your company's policy to accept gifts. Therefore, the policy must be followed.

A. 1.01
B. 0.94
C. 0.99
D. 1.11
Correct Answer: C
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
To calculate the cumulative cost performance index (CPI) you have to add up the earned values (EVs) and actual costs (ACs) for all months up to the point at which you need the cumulative CPI. So in this case, the cumulative EV would be $27,000 + $147,000 + $101,000 = $275,000 and the cumulative AC would be $19,000 + $151,500 + $106,900 = $277,400. You would then use the following formula: cumulative CPI = cumulative EV / cumulative AC. This results in a cumulative CPI of $275,000 / $277,400 = 0.99.

Active or passive acceptance is an appropriate strategy when a risk is small, unavoidable, unknown, and cannot be transferred, shared, or mitigated. Passive acceptance involves doing nothing unless a risk event occurs and then dealing with the consequences. Active risk acceptance involves accepting a risk, but planning beforehand how to deal with the consequences if the risk occurs.
