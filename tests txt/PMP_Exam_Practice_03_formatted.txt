Q36The banks in the Ukraine have raised the annual interest rates sharply to 30 percent. You have the option to invest your money either in Ukrainian banks or to build a small factory for a client. The total cost of building the factory will be $12 million but it will spread evenly over one year ($1 million payable by the end of each month for the next 12 months). The client will make a payment of $3.9 million at the end of each quarter from the start of the project. Which of the following is the best option (if you are only considering the return on investment)?

A. Build the factory for the client
B. Invest the money in the bank for a year
C. Both options offer the same payoff
D. Information given is insufficient to determine the best option Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
In this scenario you are considering investing your money in the bank or building a factory. Since all transactions are not happening at the same point in time, we need to discount the cash flows and then determine the return on investment. Since the bank is offering a 30% annual interest rate (the opportunity cost if you decide to build the factory), you need to discount all the cash flows for the factory project by 2.5% (30% / 12) on a monthly basis. The discount formula is: Present Value (PV) = Future Value / (1 + interest rate)^period. Let's use this formula to determine the net present value of all cash outflows:
Month 1: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^1 = 975,610
Month 2: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^2 = 951,814
Month 3: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^3 = 928,599
Month 4: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^4 = 905,951
Month 5: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^5 = 883,854
Month 6: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^6 = 862,297
Month 7: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^7 = 841,265
Month 8: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^8 = 820,747
Month 9: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^9 = 800,728
Month 10: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^10=781,198
Month 11: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^11=762,145
Month 12: PV = 1,000,000/(1+2.5%)^12=743,556
Adding these up we get the total PV of outflows = 10,257,765 Now let's calculate the PV of all inflows using the same formula:
Quarter 1: PV = 3,900,000/(1+2.5%)^3 = 3,621,538
Quarter 2: PV = 3,900,000/(1+2.5%)^6 = 3,362,958
Quarter 3: PV = 3,900,000/(1+2.5%)^9 = 3,122,841
Quarter 4: PV = 3,900,000/(1+2.5%)^12 = 2,899,868
Adding these up we get the total PV of inflows = 13,007,204 The return on investment (today) = (13,007,204 - 10,257,765)*100 / 10,257,765 = 27% Since the bank is offering an annual 30% return on investment, it is advisable not to undertake the project and leave the money in the bank account.

Q40A project was estimated to cost $200,000 with a timeline of 10 months. Due to a shipment delay, the schedule was slightly delayed. However, this was made up by shipping the first batch of materials for the project by air. The net result was that there was some additional cost in the project. At the end of the second month, the Project Manager reviews the project and finds that the project is 20% complete and Actual Costs are $50,000. The Estimate to Complete (ETC) for the project would now be:

A. $160,000
B. $210,000
C. $250,000
D. $200,000
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The budget at completion (BAC) = $200,000 (given). The Actual Cost (AC) = $50,000 (given). The Earned value (EV) = (2/10) * 200,000 since 20% of the project is complete; i.e., 2 months out of 10. Hence, Earned Value (EV) = $40,000. This is an instance of an atypical situation in the project. Late arrival of materials does not mean that all subsequent material will arrive late. Hence, the calculation used for EAC is EAC = AC + BAC " EV = 50,000 + 200,000 " 40,000 = $210,000. Since ETC = EAC " AC = 210,000 " 50,000 = $160,000.

Q41You have a team of engineers working on your project. Two of the engineers have frequent disagreements. You ask them to resolve their differences through a discussion. However, that does not yield any results. Subsequently, you intervene, and based on your analysis of the situation, you suggest some changes in the way they work with each other. This still does not yield results, and you find that the project schedule is beginning to suffer. What is your next course of action?

A. Take disciplinary action, if required, since the needs of the project are not being met.
B. Don't do anything. Differences of opinion among the team members are a healthy situation.
C. Speak to the two team members and ask them to resolve their conflict amicably.
D. Ensure that they work in different shifts so that they don't clash with each other.
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
After the project manager has tried intervening, it is time to employ more formal conflict resolution mechanisms, such as disciplinary action. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 348] [Project Resource Management]

Q47Many project managers have seen a graph that shows "Influence of Stakeholders" starting out high and declining as the project progresses. In contrast, it also shows the "Cost of Changes" starting out low and increasing as the project progresses. What is the key insight a project manager should gain from this graph?

A. Stakeholder influence is not important at the end of the project.
B. Make changes as early in the project as possible.
C. Set aside money for expected changes at the end of the project.
D. Place the project on hold until all changes are made.
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Changes should be made as early as possible in the project to avoid additional cost and delays. The influence of stakeholders is high at the start of the project and low towards the end. In contrast, the cost of making changes in a project is low at the start of a project and high towards the end. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 549] [Project Framework]

Q49The best practice to gather and document lessons learned is during weekly progress meetings. The agenda can have a lessons-learned brainstorming item at the end of these meetings. You can ask team members to put forward their recommendations, but it is always better to adopt a more structured way to gather lessons learned. Which of the following approaches will ensure you capture important lessons learned on your project?

A. Planning risk responses
B. Determining estimate to complete
C. Review of project variances
D. Signing off on the minutes of the meeting
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Signing off minutes of the meeting is a good meeting management technique specially in highly bureaucratic environments. However, this doesn't help at all in gathering lessons learned. Planning risk responses and determining estimates to complete are forward look-ahead of the project. Lessons learned can be captured through the review of project variances. You review the variances again and focus on how to avoid them in the future. You also identify other tasks or people who are likely to encounter the same issue so it can be avoided.
