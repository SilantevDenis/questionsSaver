Q8Your company is considering buying a building worth $1 million. If the company buys this building and rents it out for the next five years, it will get $100,000 per year as rent (receivable by the end of each year). At the end of the fifth year, the company will resell the building at $1.1 million. What is the NPV of this investment at 10 percent per annum discount rate?

A. 62092
B. 600000
C. 1600000
D. 2200000
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
NPV = discounted inflows " discounted outflows Since the full investment, i.e. $1 million, needs to be made now, we don't have to discount the outflows. However, we need to discount all the inflows by 10% per annum. The discount formula is: Present Value (PV) = Future Value / (1 + discount rate)^period For year 1:
PV1 = 100,000 / 1.1^1 = 90,909 For year 2: PV1 = 100,000 / 1.1^2 = 82,645 For year 3: PV1 = 100,000 / 1.1^3 = 75,131 For year 4: PV1 = 100,000 / 1.1^4 = 68,301 For year 5: PV1 = 1,200,000 / 1.1^5 = 745,106 Hence the total PV of the inflows = 1,062,092 NPV = 1,062,092 " 1,000,000 = $62,092 [PMBOK 5th edition, Pages 34, 473] [Project Integration Management]

Q48You are managing a project that has a task to translate several pages of a document into Spanish. This is similar to a project done last year when a document was translated into German. You are not sure how long it will take to translate into Spanish, so you look at the project plan from the German translation and use that activity duration for your current project. What type of estimating is this an example of?

A. Hypothesis
B. Parametric Estimating
C. Analogous Estimating
D. What-if Scenario Analysis
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
