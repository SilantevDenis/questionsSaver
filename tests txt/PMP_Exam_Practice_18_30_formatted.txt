Q1You just initiated a project to establish windmills in a developing country. To celebrate the initiation of the project, the customers arranged a party in which a key customer offered valuables to you and all your project team members with a request to complete the project sooner than the actual finish date. What should you do?

A. Accept the offer and agree to finish the project early
B. Reject the offer because it violates the code of ethics and professional conduct
C. Accept the offer but refuse to complete the project early
D. Reject the offer and do not communicate with that customer Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Since the stakeholder made a request by offering gifts, you should refuse the offer. The PMI's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct suggests that a project manager should never engage in unfairness.
Favoring one or more customers by taking gifts is not allowed. Thus, you should reject the offer because it violates the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Not communicating with one customer could impair relationships with other customers. If it is customary in that country to offer gifts, you might accept them without agreeing to the customer's request. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof.

Q2You overlooked a high-level risk in an insurance project and failed to document it in the project charter. If the risk shows up during the planning phase, what should be your response as a project manager?

A. Take the responsibility and evaluate the impact
B. Call a customer meeting to inform them that risk has occurred
C. Refer to the sponsor for advice
D. Develop the risk response plan and communicate to the team Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
According to the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, project managers must take ownership of the decisions they make or fail to make. Thus, you should take responsibility and evaluate the impact first. A risk response plan should be developed only after evaluating the impact. Calling a customer meeting cannot deal with the risk. You should escalate it to the sponsor only if the risk is beyond your control. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q3You have recently started working as a project manager for a public school construction project. Your analysis shows that the cost estimate for the project seems to be unreasonable, and it could take at least 25 percent more funding to complete the project. What should you do if your sponsor wants to undertake the project with another project manager in case you refuse to accept it?

A. Conduct a customer focus meeting to explain the facts
B. Resign from the project and let the sponsor assign a new project manager
C. Submit detailed facts to the supervisor supporting your argument
D. Continue with the project and document the limited budget as a constraint Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Project managers have the responsibility to present truthful and accurate information regarding costs, schedules, and resources. Submit the facts that substantiate your argument. If your argument is valid, then the sponsor might agree with you. Talking to customers is not appropriate. Continuing the project might cause it to fail. It is inappropriate to resign from the project without presenting the facts. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Answer: 



Q4You have recently started working as a project manager for a health insurance portal development project. The project sponsor tells you that due to the critical nature of the project, the work must start immediately and complete in two weeks. Based on the instructions, you have started documenting significant constraints and assumptions to perform the project feasibility study. What should you do if you can prepare only the high-level feasibility study in the given time frame?

A. Conduct the stakeholder meeting to evaluate other options
B. Refer this issue to the sponsor and explain the need for more detailed study
C. Submit the high level study and start making plans to prepare the charter
D. Submit the high level study and schedule a detailed study in the planning phase Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Developing a detailed feasibility study is essential to initiate a project. If efforts are not made initially to determine whether the project is worth the required investment, it could result in project failure. It is also the responsibility of the project manager to provide accurate and complete information about the feasibility of any project. Thus, you must escalate the issue to the sponsor and explain the need for a more detailed study. Since the project initiation depends on the feasibility of the project, the report cannot be prepared in the project planning phase. Conducting stakeholder meeting is an invalid choice because the stakeholders have not yet been selected to conduct a meeting.

One of the mandatory standards for a project manager is to behave responsibly and bid on only those projects for which the project manager's employer has expertise and skills. Since Danny bid on a project for which his company lacks expertise, he violated the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. There is no procurement code in project management.

Q6In a software development project, Debby, the project manager, completed development of a charter and identification of stakeholders.

A. Deny the request as the manager is not part of the project
B. Accept the request as the manager belongs to the same organization
C. Deny the request to protect the confidentiality of the information
D. Accept the request but caution the manager to maintain confidentiality Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
It is the responsibility of the project manager to maintain confidentiality of protected or proprietary information. A project manager should provide such confidential information only to the sponsor and to the vendor evaluation committee or whoever is involved in the evaluation. He or she must not provide this information to any other employees within the organization or within the project. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Answer: 



Q7You are responsible for developing high-level risks, assumptions, and constraints for your project. You meet with experts in your organization and document various risks in the project. However, in reviewing historical data from a previous project, you notice a significant additional risk to your project, one that no one else is aware of. What should you do to continue the project?

A. Do not document the risk since it is based on past data
B. Document it but make it a low-level risk
C. Document it and make it a high-level risk
D. Do not document the risk since nobody knows about it
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
As a project manager, you have a responsibility to disclose accurate information to all project stakeholders honestly. Project managers must not disseminate false or misleading information. Thus, you must document it as a high-level risk. Even though the risk is based on past data, it must be documented because the risks could also be identified from the past data. Documenting it as a low-level risk would be a misleading act, and a project manager must not do that. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Answer: 



Q8You are using the one-on-one interview technique to gather high-level risks, assumptions, and constraints in an infrastructure development project to set up a bank. During the interview process, a key stakeholder tells you that the project might fail due to lack of support from local people. What should you do in this situation?

A. Escalate the stakeholder's comments to the sponsor for his advice
B. Investigate the reasons behind the stakeholder's comments
C. Document the stakeholder's comments and continue with the project
D. Ignore the stakeholder's comments and continue with the project Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
You must document the comments from the stakeholder. However, you should not continue the project until you also understand his or her rationale. The sponsor might ask you to look into it, so escalating the stakeholder's comments to the sponsor may not yield anything. Ignoring the stakeholder's comments is not advisable. Thus, the correct step is to investigate the reasons behind the stakeholder's comments. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q9You have started a project to establish a railroad between two neighboring cities. The state agency that sponsors this project is heavily committed to completing this project on time and within budget. In support of the agency's commitment, you have completed the charter and started identifying stakeholders who would support the project. You would like to gather as many stakeholders as possible and move on to the planning phase. What should a project manager do while identifying stakeholders in a project?

A. Notify the negative stakeholders to talk to the sponsor
B. Identify positive stakeholders and eliminate negative stakeholders to gather maximum support for the project
C. Identify positive stakeholders and ask negative stakeholders to leave the project
D. Identify both the positive and negative stakeholders and address their concerns Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Project stakeholders are people, organizations, or groups whose interests are positively or negatively impacted by the project. A project manager must identify both the positive and negative stakeholders forsuccessful completion of the project. Eliminating the negative stakeholders or keeping them away from the project will jeopardize the objectives of the project and may cause the project to fail. One of the mandatory standards for a project manager is to show fairness and disclose potential conflicts of interest to stakeholders. He or she should escalate issues to the sponsor only when he or she fails in influencing negative stakeholders. Thus, the correct answer is to identify both the positive and negative stakeholders and address their concerns. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q10During a three-year construction project, due to a shortage of resources, a project manager has decided to develop a partial work breakdown structure (WBS) in the beginning of the planning phase. The WBS will be expanded as more information becomes known in the near term. What should the project manager do if a key resource criticizes his or her decision to develop the partial WBS?

A. Ignore the resource's comments
B. Remove the resource from the project
C. Redevelop the complete work breakdown structure for all three years
D. Explain to the resource about the Rolling Wave planning
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
One of the mandatory standards for a project manager is to show respect to others by holding them in high regard. A project manager must respect others' viewpoints. A project manager need not develop a complete WBS during the initial stages of planning. In long projects, the WBS can be developed partially and can be extended as more details become known later; this approach is known as rolling wave planning.
The project manager should explain rolling wave planning to the resource. Ignoring the resource's comments or removing the resource are not appropriate responses. [PMBOK 6th Edition, Page 185 and PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q11You are using parametric estimating techniques to estimate costs for each activity and the total budget in your project. However, a project manager colleague tells you to bump up each estimate by 20 percent to account for any unknown risks, and then submit that as a total budget to the customers. What should you do?

A. Do not inflate the estimate
B. Inform the customer and then inflate the estimate
C. Inflate the estimate first and inform the customer
D. Inflate the estimate but do not inform the customer
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Honesty is a mandatory standard for project managers. Project managers are required to provide accurate information to customers regarding budget, resources, and risks. Unknown risks can be dealt with by using reserves. Deliberately inflating budget or schedule values or making misleading or false statements is against the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Hence, the best course of action here is to not inflate the estimate. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q12Two of your team members are constantly arguing with each other about work assignments. Due to their attitude, the project is delayed, and pressure is building on other team members. What should you do?

A. Issue a memo
B. Meet with them to understand their concerns
C. Inform the concerned functional manager
D. Replace the team members
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
One of the mandatory standards in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is respect. A project manager must listen to others' points of view and understand them. Hence, you must meet with the team members first to understand their concerns. If the problem continues, you may issue a memo or even replace the team members if necessary. Talking to the functional manager may not resolve the problem as the team members are managed by you in your project.

B. Submit the need to merge to the customer
C. Merge the deliverables but do not inform the customer
D. Merge the deliverables but do not update the project management plan Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The customer must be notified about any changes made to deliverables because acceptance of deliverables is key to a successful project. It is the responsibility of the project manager to notify appropriate stakeholders before making changes. Kurt must submit the proposed merge to the customer. Once the customer accepts the change, Kurt can merge the deliverables and notify the customer that this has been done. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

B. Refuse to take the assignment
C. Obtain an expert's judgment to help select the project
D. Inform the management about lack of knowledge on project selection methods Correct Answer: D

Therefore, Mario should tell the management about his lack of knowledge of project selection methods. Attempting to select the project without expert knowledge could create problems later. Refusing the assignment is not an appropriate action. Management may suggest soliciting expert judgment for selecting the project, but informing the management is the first step to take, and it is up to management to decide what to do next.

D. Provide more access to project information compared to other stakeholders Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)

Explanation/Reference:
All stakeholders must be identified as early as possible in the project. The stakeholders can be positive or negative. They must be classified based on their influence, interest, expectations, and importance. A project manager must not hide information. He or she must provide equal access to all stakeholders who are authorized to have that information. Thus, Jack must involve the influential stakeholders from the beginning of the project and manage them closely.

A. Encourage your classmate by offering some tips
B. Resign from the interview panel
C. Remove your classmate from the list

Therefore, your first step is to inform the interview panel of the relationship. Offering tips to your classmate would violate the fairness standard of the PMI code of ethics and professional conduct. Removing your classmate is not appropriate.

A. Conduct a meeting with the sponsor, team leader, and the team member
B. Approach the team member and understand his point of view
C. Replace the team member
D. Direct your team leader to issue a memo
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation

A project manager should manage such a conflict by directly approaching the team member who caused the conflict. According to the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, a project manager must be responsible and show respect. He or she must listen to others' viewpoints, seeking to understand them before making a decision. Neither replacing the team member nor issuing a memo is an appropriate action.
Involving the sponsor in team issues is not an appropriate action either, unless the issues are beyond the project manager's control. [PMBOK 6th Edition, Page 348 and PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Project Resource Management]

A. Advise your new recruit to complete his certification
B. Report to the PMI
C. Report to the sponsor
D. Request more information from the new recruit
Correct Answer: D

D. Report to Project Management Institute (PMI)
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation

Project managers should neither accept nor deny critical requests from the customer until they have sufficient factual information. Thus, in this situation, you should first listen to the customer and understand his viewpoint. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q30You have just started leading a World Bank healthcare development project in a developing country in which it is customary to offer lunch when a project is initiated. Although your team members are willing to accept the offer, you decide to refuse the offer since you know the PMI's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct does not allow you to accept gifts. Which of the following statements about your decision is correct?

A. Your decision is wrong because you should obey the norms and customs of others as long as you do not favor them.
B. Your decision is correct because you are engaging yourself in unethical behavior by accepting the lunch.

D. Your decision is wrong because conduct rules only apply to local projects, not international projects.
Correct Answer: A

Although the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct does not allow gift-taking, project managers should respect the norms and customs of others as long as they do not show favoritism based on those norms. Therefore, in this situation, your decision is incorrect because you should respect the norms and customs of others as long as you do not favor them. The PMI code of conduct applies to both local and international projects. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility] [Prof. Responsibility]
