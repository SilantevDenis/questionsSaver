B. Communications management plan
C. Project management information system (PMIS)
D. Scope management plan
Correct Answer: C

Q12A project manager is managing his second project. It started one month after the first one did, and both projects are still in process. Though his first project is small, the new project seems to be quickly growing in size. As each day passes, the project manager is feeling more and more in need of help. The project manager has recently heard that there was another project in the company last year that was similar to his second project. What should he do?

A. Contact the project manager for the other project, and ask for assistance.
B. Obtain historical records and guidance from the project management office (PMO).
C. Wait to see if the project is impacted by the growth in scope.
D. Make sure the scope of the project is agreed to by all the stakeholders.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Project Management Framework
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
There are many things the project manager could do. Asking the other project manager for assistance is not the best choice, as the other project manager might not be an experienced mentor. Her advice might not be adequate to help this project manager. Waiting to assess the impact on the project is reactive; a project manager should be proactive. Gaining agreement of all the stakeholders on the project scope is also not the best choice. It would be helpful, but does not specifically address the issue in this situation. By contacting the PMO, the project manager can access the knowledge of many project managers, historical information from many projects, and the assistance of someone whose job it is to help.

Answer: 



Q13To obtain support for the project throughout the performing organization, its best if the project manager:

A. Ensures there is a communications management plan
B. Correlates the need for the project to the organizations strategic plan
C. Connects the project to the personal objectives of the sponsor
D. Confirms that the management plan includes the management of team members Correct Answer: B
Section: Project Management Framework
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Connecting the project to the sponsors objectives might be a good idea, but it does not address the issue of obtaining support throughout the performing organization. Neither ensuring there is a communications management plan nor confirming that the management plan includes the management of team members directly addresses the need to obtain support for the project. Correlating the need for the project to the organization's strategic plan is the best way to gain support for the project.

Q14Your management team has decided that all orders will be treated as projects and that project managers will be used to update orders daily, to resolve issues, and to ensure the customer formally accepts the product within 30 days of completion. Revenue from the individual orders can vary from $100 to $150,000. The project manager will not be required to perform planning or provide documentation other than daily status. How would you define this situation?

Q16A project team is working on manufacturing a new product, but they are having difficulty creating a project charter. What is the best description of the real problem?

A. They have not identified the project objectives.
B. They are working on a process and not a project.
C. The end date has not been set.
D. They have not identified the product of the project.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Project Management Framework
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Manufacturing a product is an ongoing process; it is operational work, not project work. Therefore, the manufacturing team would have no reason to create a project charter and would have difficulty doing so if they tried, because of the ongoing nature of the work. If the question referred to a team developing a new product, however, that would qualify as a project.

Answer:

B. The project management team
C. The project management office (PMO)
D. The project team
Correct Answer: C
Section: Project Management Framework
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Because the question talks about priorities between projects, this cannot be the role of the project manager, the project management team, or the project team. Determining priorities between projects is a role of the PMO.

Answer:

Why are they beneficial? The best uses of lessons learned are as continuous improvement within the current project, historical records for future projects, and improving the organizations processes and systems. There are other tools that are better for accomplishing the things listed in the other choices.

Answer:

B. Planning
C. Closing
D. Initiating
Correct Answer: D

Answer: 



Q27The project team has just completed the initial project schedule and budget. The next thing to do is to:

A. Identify risks.
B. Begin iterations.
C. Determine communications requirements.
D. Create a bar (Gantt) chart.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Project Management Processes
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Communications requirements and quality standards are needed before risks (especially risks related to communications and quality) can be determined. Iterations cannot begin until the risks are identified, qualified, and quantified, and the responses are developed. Through iterations, the WBS and other parts of the project management plan are revised. A bar chart would have been done during the creation of the schedule, so it cannot be the next thing. Of the choices listed, determine communications requirements is the best option.

Answer: 



Q28A detailed project schedule can be created only after creating the:

A. Project budget
B. Work breakdown structure
C. Project management plan
D. Detailed risk assessment
Correct Answer: B
Section: Project Management Processes
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:

Q30Which of the following is not an input to the initiating process group?

A. Company processes
B. Company culture
C. Historical WBSs
D. Project scope statement
Correct Answer: D
Section: Project Management Processes
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Notice the question asks which is not an input to project initiating. Did you read it correctly? Companies should have processes in place for hiring resources, reporting, and managing risks on projects (to name only a few). These are inputs to project initiating, as are company culture and historical WBSs. The project scope statement is an output of project planning.

Answer: 



Q31The project sponsor has just signed the project charter. What is the next thing to do?

A. Begin to complete work packages.
B. Validate scope.
C. Start integrated change control.
D. Start to create management plans.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Project Management Processes
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
To answer this type of question, look for the choice that occurs closest to the process group you are in. The project charter is created during project initiating. Completing work packages is done during project executing. Validating scope and performing integrated change control are done during project monitoring and controlling. Starting to create management plans is the best choice, as it is part of project planning.

Answer: 



Q32The high-level project schedule constraints have just been determined. What project management process group are you in?

Q33The WBS and WBS dictionary have been completed, and the project team has begun working on identifying risks. The sponsor contacts the project manager, requesting that the responsibility assignment matrix be issued. The project has a budget of $ 100,000 and is taking place in three countries using 14 human resources. There is little risk expected for the project, and the project manager has managed many projects similar to this one. What is the next thing to do?

A. Understand the experience of the sponsor on similar projects.
B. Create an activity list.
C. Make sure the project scope is defined.
D. Complete risk management and issue the responsibility assignment matrix.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Project Management Processes
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Look at the order of planning the project that the team has chosen. Although understanding the experience of the sponsor might sound like a good idea, the sponsor is a stakeholder, and understanding the stakeholders is part of stakeholder analysis. That should have occurred before the creation of a WBS.
Project scope must be defined before a WBS can be created. Completing risk management and issuing the responsibility assignment matrix cannot be best, as that work does not come next in the process. Other work must be done before risk management can effectively be completed. Creating an activity list comes next after the WBS and WBS dictionary.

Answer: 



Q34A project manager does not have much time to spend on planning before the mandatory start date arrives. He therefore wants to move through planning as effectively as possible. What advice would you offer?

A. Make sure you have a signed project charter and then start the WBS.
B. Create an activity list before creating a network diagram.
C. Document all the known risks before you document the high-level assumptions.
D. Finalize the quality management plan before you determine quality metrics.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Project Management Processes
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This question is asking which of the choices is the most effective way to move through project planning.
Starting the WBS immediately after obtaining a project charter skips the important steps of defining the scope and other activities. High-level assumptions are determined in project initiating. Quality metrics are determined as part of the quality management plan, not after it. The activity list is created before the network diagram, so that is the best option.

Answer:

A. Closing
B. Monitoring and controlling
C. Executing
D. Initiating
Correct Answer: C
Section: Project Management Processes

A. Create a detailed description of the project deliverables.
B. Get familiar with the company culture and structure as they relate to the project.
C. Identify the root cause of problems.
D. Ensure all project management processes are complete.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Project Management Processes

Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A detailed description of the project deliverables is created during project planning, as part of creating the project scope statement. Root cause analysis occurs during project monitoring and controlling, not initiating.
Ensuring all project management processes are complete occurs during project closing. It is important for a project manager to become familiar with the company culture and structure as they relate to the project as early in the project as possible. This is the most appropriate choice to do in project initiating.

Q52The customer has accepted the completed project scope. However, the lessons learned required by the project management office have not been completed. What is the status of the project?

A. The project is incomplete because it needs to be replanned.
B. The project is incomplete until all project and product deliverables are complete and accepted.
C. The project is complete because the customer has accepted the deliverables.
D. The project is complete because it has reached its due date.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Replanning is uncalled for by the situation described. Reaching the planned completion date does not mean the project is necessarily finished. A project is complete when all work, including all project management work, is complete, and the product of the project and all project deliverables are accepted. The lessons learned are project management deliverables, and therefore must be completed for the project to be complete.

Q54The customer on a project tells the project manager they have run out of money to pay for the project. What should the project manager do first?

A. Shift more of the work to later in the schedule to allow time for the customer to get the funds.
B. Close Project or Phase.
C. Stop work.
D. Release part of the project team.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Every project must be closed, as closure provides benefit to the performing organization. This means simply stopping work is not the best choice. Shifting work and releasing team members will only postpone dealing with the problem, not solve it. The best thing for the project manager to do is begin the Close Project or Phase process.

Q58Effective project integration usually requires an emphasis on:

A. The careers of the team members
B. Timely updates to the project management plan
C. Effective communication at key interface points
D. Product control
Correct Answer: C
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This question is asking for the most important of the choices. Think about what is involved in integration:
project management plan development, project management plan execution, and integrated change control. Updates and product control are parts of project monitoring and controlling, while integration includes more than control. Advancing the careers of team members falls under project executing (the Develop Project Team process). To integrate the project components into a cohesive whole, communication is key whenever one activity will interface with another or one team member will interface with another, and when any other form of interfacing will occur.

Q67You have taken over a project during project planning and have discovered that six individuals have signed the project charter. Which of the following should most concern you?

A. Who will be a member of the change control board
B. Spending more time on configuration management
C. Getting a single project sponsor
D. Determining the reporting structure
Correct Answer: B
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Determining who will be on the change control board and determining the reporting structure may have already been done. In any case, these choices are not directly impacted by the number of sponsors who have signed the charter. Having a single project sponsor is not necessary. This situation implies that there are six areas concerned with this project. In addition to focusing on the added communications requirements, you should be concerned with competing needs and requirements impacting your efforts on configuration management.

Q68The project manager is working to clearly describe the level of involvement expected from everyone on the project in order to prevent rework, conflict, and coordination problems. Which of the following best describes the project manager's efforts?

A. Develop Project Management Plan and Plan Quality Management
B. Manage Stakeholder Engagement and Direct and Manage Project Work
C. Validate Scope and Control Quality
D. Identify Risks and Develop Project Team
Correct Answer: A
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Notice that this question uses the words 'working to clearly describe' and 'prevent.' Taken together, they should tell you the project is in project planning. This eliminates all choices except Develop Project Management Plan and Plan Quality Management. Coordination and conflict prevention relate to Develop Project Management Plan, and preventing rework is part of Plan Quality Management.

Q69All the following are parts of the Direct and Manage Project Work process except:

A. Identifying changes
B. Using a work breakdown structure
C. Implementing corrective actions
D. Setting up a project control system
Correct Answer: D
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A WBS is created in project planning, but can be used to help manage the project during project executing.
The wording in the question was not 'creating a WBS,' but 'using a WBS.' A project control system is set up during project planning, not during project executing, and therefore is the exception.

Q70A project manager is appointed to head a highly technical project in an area with which this person has limited familiarity. The project manager delegates the processes of Develop Schedule, Estimate Costs, Define Activities, and Estimate Activity Resources to various project team members, and basically serves as an occasional referee and coordinator of activities. The results of this approach are likely to be:

A. A team functioning throughout the project at a very high level, demonstrating creativity and commitment
B. A team that initially experiences some amounts of confusion, but that after a period of time becomes a cohesive and effective unit
C. A team that is not highly productive, but that stays together because of the work environment created by the project manager
D. A team that is characterized by poor performance, low morale, high levels of conflict, and high turnover Correct Answer: D
Section: Integration Management

A. Show how the resources were originally promised to your project.
B. Replan the project without the resources.
C. Explain the impact if the promised resources are not made available.
D. Crash the project.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Crashing and replanning are essentially delaying the problem. Instead, the project manager should try to prevent it by showing the consequences if the resources are not available. This is a more effective strategy than saying, 'But you gave those resources to me.'

A. Ask management how the new project will use resources.
B. Resource level your project.
C. Crash your project.
D. Ask management how the new project will affect your project.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
You do not have enough information to consider resource leveling or crashing this project.

Q77In the middle of the project, the project manager is informed by her scheduler that the project control limits are secure. That same morning, she receives a note from a team member about a problem he is having. The note says, 'This activity is driving me crazy, and the manager of the accounting department won't help me until the activity's float is in jeopardy.' In addition, the project manager has emails from a minor stakeholder and 14 emails from team members. While she is reading the emails, a team member walks into the project manager's office to tell her a corrective action was implemented by a team member from the project management office, but was not documented. What should the project manager do next?

A. Report the documentation violation to the project management office, evaluate the security of the control limits, and review the emailing rules in the communications management plan.
B. Clarify the reasoning behind documentation being a problem, get the accounting department to assist the team member, and respond to the minor stakeholder.
C. Add the implemented corrective action to the change log, discuss the value of documentation at the next team meeting, and smooth the team member's issue with the accounting department.
D. Find out who caused the problem with the accounting department, respond to the minor stakeholder before responding to the other emails, and review the process in the communications management plan for reporting concerns with the team member having the documentation problem.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Notice how much information is thrown at you in this question. It is important to practice reading through questions to discover what is important and what is simply background information. In this question, the only thing relevant was the corrective action taken. Once you discover what the primary issue is, look at the choices to find out which is best for addressing that issue. What is the primary issue here? Did you realize the team members note is about a non-critical path activity? ('Until the project float is in jeopardy' means there is float; thus, the activity is not on the critical path.) So, is the issue the non-critical path activity or the documentation? You might disagree with the logic, but in this case the answer is the documentation. In the real world, problems often repeat. Without a record of what was done, there is no opportunity to consider the same solution for future problems. Documentation is critical to projects. Because the change log becomes part of the historical records database, it is best to first record the corrective action taken, then discuss the value of documentation at the next team meeting, and, finally, smooth the team members issue with the accounting department.

Q78The client demands changes to the product specification that will add only two weeks to the critical path. Which of the following is the best thing for the project manager to do?

A. Compress the schedule to recover the two weeks.
B. Cut scope to recover the two weeks.
C. Consult with the sponsor about options.
D. Advise the client of the impact of the change.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Do you remember what to do when there is a change? Evaluate first. You wouldn't take action before getting approval, so compressing the schedule or cutting scope would happen after consulting the sponsor and/or advising the client of the impact of the change. You would not go to the customer before going to your internal management, so advising the client is not the correct thing to do next. The next step is to discuss options with the sponsor.

Q79During executing, the project manager determines that a change is needed to material purchased for the project. The project manager calls a meeting of the team to plan how to make the change. This is an example of:

A. Management by objectives
B. Lack of a change management plan
C. Good team relations
D. Lack of a clear work breakdown structure
Correct Answer: B
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project manager is asking how to make a change. Such a question cannot be resolved using management by objectives, team relations, or a work breakdown structure. The procedures, forms, sign- offs, and other similar requirements for handling changes should have already been determined in the change management plan. Because they were not, the project manager will waste valuable work time trying to figure it out after the fact.

Answer: 



Q80The project was going well when all of a sudden there were changes to the project coming from multiple stakeholders. After all the changes were determined, the project manager spent time with the stakeholders to find out why there were changes and to discover any more. The project work had quieted down when a team member casually mentioned to the project manager that he added functionality to a product of the project. 'Do not worry,' he said, 'I did not impact schedule, cost, or quality!' What should the project manager do first?

A. Ask the team member how the need for the functionality was determined.
B. Hold a meeting to review the team member's completed work.
C. Look for other added functionality.
D. Ask the team member how he knows there is no schedule, cost, or quality impact.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Notice that the first paragraph is extraneous. Also notice that the question states that the change has already been made. The project manager's actions would be different if the change had not been made.
The project manager, with the help of others, must determine how the change impacts the project as a whole. Asking the team member how he knows there is no impact on schedule, cost, or quality is the best answer. This begins the project manager's analysis of the impacts to the project as a whole by finding out what analysis has already been done. This change minimally involves a change to the scope baseline, and likely other baselines as well. A change request must ultimately be submitted to integrated change control, but that is not listed as an option.

Q83A project is chartered to determine new ways to extend the product life of one of the company's medium- producing products. The project manager comes from the engineering department, and the team comes from the product management and marketing departments.
The project scope statement and project planning are completed when a stakeholder notifies the team that there is a better way to complete one of the work packages. The stakeholder supplies a technical review letter from his department proving that the new way to complete the work package will actually be faster than the old way.
The project manager has had similar experiences with this department on other projects, and was expecting this to happen on this project. What is the first thing the project manager should do?

A. Contact the department and complain again about their missing the deadline for submission of scope.
B. Determine how this change will impact the cost to complete the work package and the quality of the product of the work package.
C. See if there is a way to change from a matrix organization to a functional organization so as to eliminate all the interference from other departments.
D. Ask the department if they have any other changes.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Complaining about the missed deadline could be done, but it is not proactive. It would be helpful to get to the root cause of why this department always comes up with such ideas or changes after the project begins.
However, this is not the immediate problem; the change is the immediate problem, and therefore complaining is not best. The type of project organization described is a matrix organization. There is not anything inherently wrong with such an organization, nor is there anything in this particular situation that would require it to be changed. So, changing the way the company is organized cannot be best. The department's history indicates that asking if the department has other changes is something that should definitely be done, but the proposed change needs more immediate attention. Looking at impacts of the change begins integrated change control.

Q91The engineering department has uncovered a problem with the cost accounting system and has asked the systems department to analyze what is wrong and fix the problem. You are a project manager working with the cost accounting program on another project. Management has issued a change request to the change control board to add the new work to your project.
Your existing project has a cost performance index (CPI) of 1.2 and a schedule performance index (SPI) of 1.3, so you have some room to add work without delaying your existing project or going over budget. However, you cannot see how the new work fits within the project charter for your existing project. After some analysis, you determine that the new work and existing work do not overlap and can be done concurrently. They also require different skill sets. Which of the following is the best thing to do?

A. Develop a project charter.
B. Reestimate the project schedule with input from the engineering department.
C. Validate the scope of the new work with the help of the stakeholders.
D. Identify specific changes to the existing work.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
How long did it take you to read this question? Expect long-winded questions like this on the exam. Take another look at the choices before you continue reading.
This question is essentially asking if the new work should be added to the existing project. There may be many business reasons to try to do this, but from a project management perspective, major additions to the project are generally discouraged. In this case, the new work is a self-contained unit of work, has no overlap with the existing work, does not fit within the project charter, and needs a different skill set. Therefore, it is best to make it a new project.
The first step to answering this question is to realize that the work should be a separate project. The second step is to look at the choices and see which relates to initiating a new project. Reestimating the project sounds like the best choice only if you did not realize that the new work should be a separate project.
Validating scope is done during project monitoring and controlling, and does not relate to the decision of whether to add work to the project. Identifying scope changes also implies that the new work has been accepted as an addition to the existing project. Developing a project charter is among the first steps of initiating a new project, and the best choice in this situation.

Q92All technical work is completed on the project. Which of the following remains to be done?

A. Validate Scope
B. Plan Risk Responses
C. Create a staffing management plan
D. Complete lessons learned
Correct Answer: D
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Did you pick Validate Scope? Then you may have forgotten that the Validate Scope process is done during project monitoring and controlling, not project closing. Planning the risk responses and creating the staffing management plan are done earlier in the project. The lessons learned can only be completed after the work is completed.

Q94The organization is about to begin a series of similar projects. The projects will be managed consecutively. Each project involves developing an online cooking video focused on foods appropriate to the month in which they will be released. For example, the summer videos will include picnic food and cool treats, and the December video will feature holiday foods for Hanukkah, Christmas, and Kwanzaa. The project sponsor is adamant that the management plan for each project includes an emphasis on making the best possible use of the lessons learned register. He believes that other projects have not been successful because they failed to take advantage of lessons learned from previously completed projects. The lessons learned register should be updated:

A. At the end of each project phase
B. Throughout the project
C. Weekly
D. At the end of the project
Correct Answer: B
Section: Integration Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

Q99During project executing, a team member comes to the project manager because he is not sure what work he needs to accomplish on the project. Which of the following documents contains detailed descriptions of work packages?

A. WBS dictionary
B. Activity list
C. Project scope statement
D. Scope management plan
Correct Answer: A
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The WBS dictionary defines each element in the WBS. Therefore, descriptions of the work packages are in the WBS dictionary. Activity lists may identify the work package they relate to, but they do not contain detailed descriptions of the work packages. The project scope statement defines the project scope, but it does not describe the work a team member is assigned. The scope management plan describes how scope will be planned, managed, and controlled. It does not include a description of each work package.

Q103A new project manager is being mentored by a more experienced PMP-certified project manager. The new project manager is having difficulty finding enough time to manage the project because the project scope is being progressively elaborated. The PMP-certified project manager advises that the basic tools for project management, such as a work breakdown structure, can be used during project executing to assist the project manager. For which of the following can a work breakdown structure be used?

A. Communicating with the customer
B. Showing calendar dates for each work package
C. Identifying the functional managers for each team member
D. Describing the business need for the project
Correct Answer: A
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A WBS does not show dates or responsibility assignments. The business need is described in the project charter. In this situation, the project scope is being fine-tuned. It would save the project manager time in effectively managing progressive elaboration if the WBS was used as a communications tool. Using the WBS helps ensure everyone (including the customer) understands the scope of the work.

B. Scope management
C. Quality analysis
D. Scope decomposition
Correct Answer: B
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

Q105A project has just started the second phase, in which work packages are being created. A new team member has completed his work packages for this phase and has asked the project manager to validate the scope of his work packages. The team member is anxious to have the customer see his work packages. The project manager, although confident in this new team member, wants the team member to gain confidence after the customer sees his work packages. When should the Validate Scope process be done?

A. At the end of the project
B. At the beginning of the project
C. At the end of each phase of the project
D. During the planning processes
Correct Answer: C
Section: Scope Management

Q106The project is mostly complete. The project has a schedule variance of 300 and a cost variance of -900. All but one of the quality control inspections have been completed, and all have met the quality requirements. All items in the issue log have been resolved. Many of the resources have been released. The sponsor is about to call a meeting to obtain product validation when the customer notifies the project manager that they want to make a major change to the scope. The project manager should:

A. Meet with the project team to determine if this change can be made.
B. Ask the customer for a description of the change.
C. Explain that the change cannot be made at this point in the process.
D. Inform management.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Do not jump into the problem without thinking. The customer only notified the project manager that they want to make a change. They did not describe the change. The project manager should not say no until they know more about the potential change, nor should the project manager go to management without more information. The project manager must understand the nature of the change and have time to evaluate the impact of that change before doing anything else. Of these choices, the first thing to do is to determine what the change is. The project manager might then analyze the potential change with the team, but only if their input is required.

Q107You have just joined the project management office after five years of working on projects. One of the things you want to introduce to your company is the value of creating and utilizing work breakdown structures. Some of the project managers are angry that you are asking them to do 'extra work.' Which of the following is the best thing you could tell the project managers to convince them to use work breakdown structures?

A. Work breakdown structures will prevent work from slipping through the cracks.
B. Work breakdown structures are of greater value on large projects.
C. Work breakdown structures are best when the project involves contracts.
D. Work breakdown structures are the only way to identify risks.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Work breakdown structures are required on projects of every size, regardless of whether contracts are involved. Work breakdown structures can be used to help identify risks, but risks can be identified using other methods as well. Preventing work from being forgotten (slipping through the cracks) is one of the main reasons the tool is used, and is the best choice offered here.

Q108A new project manager has asked you for advice on creating a work breakdown structure. After you explain the process to her, she asks you what software she should use to create the WBS and what she should do with it when it is completed. You might respond that the picture is not the most valuable result of creating a WBS. The most valuable result of a WBS is:

A. A bar chart
B. Team buy-in
C. Activities
D. A list of risks
Correct Answer: B
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The WBS is an input to all of these choices. However, team buy-in is a direct result of the WBS creation process, while the other choices use the WBS to assist in their completion. Involving the team in creating the WBS provides project team members with an understanding of where their pieces fit into the overall project management plan and gives them an indication of the impact of their work on the project as a whole.

Q110A project manager may use__________to make sure the team members clearly know what is included in each of their work packages.

A. The project scope statement
B. The product scope
C. The WBS dictionary
D. The schedule
Correct Answer: C
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project scope statement describes work on a high-level basis. Work packages need to be specific to enable team members to complete their work without gold plating. The product scope does not tell team members what work is assigned to them. The team should have a copy of the schedule, but a schedule does not show them what work is included in each of their work packages. Work packages are described in the WBS dictionary. NOTE: Do not think of the WBS dictionary as a dictionary of terms.

A. Validate Scope
B. Control Quality
C. Manage Communications
D. Control Costs
Correct Answer: A

Q113You are managing a six-month project and have held biweekly meetings with your project stakeholders. After five-and-a-half months of work, the project is on schedule and budget, but the stakeholders are not satisfied with the deliverables. This situation will delay the project completion by one month. The most important process that could have prevented this situation is:

A. Monitor Risks
B. Control Schedule
C. Define Scope
D. Control Scope
Correct Answer: C
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Monitor Risks, Control Schedule, and Control Scope are monitoring and controlling processes. This situation asks how to prevent the problem, which would have been done during planning. The project deliverables are defined in the Define Scope process, which is a part of project planning. Good planning reduces the likelihood of a situation like the one described in the question, by including the right people and spending adequate time clarifying the project scope.

Q115One of the stakeholders on the project contacts the project manager to discuss some additional scope they would like to add to the project. The project manager asks for details in writing and then works through the Control Scope process. What should the project manager do next when the evaluation of the requested scope is complete?

A. Ask the stakeholder if any more changes are expected.
B. Complete integrated change control.
C. Make sure the impact of the change is understood by the stakeholder.
D. Find out the root cause of why the scope was not identified during project planning.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Notice that there are many things the project manager could do listed in the choices; however, the question asks what the project manager should do next. Management of the change is not complete when the Control Scope process is completed. It is important to look at the impact of the change on other parts of the project, such as schedule and budget. Therefore, performing integrated change control is the best thing to do next. This would probably be followed by making sure the impact of the change is understood by the stakeholder, then determining why this scope was not identified in planning, and asking the stakeholder if more changes are expected.

Q116During the completion of project work, the sponsor asks the project manager to report on how the project is going. In order to prepare the report, the project manager asks each of the team members what percent complete their work is. There is one team member who has been hard to manage from the beginning. In response to being asked what percent complete he is, the team member asks, 'Percent complete of what?' Tired of such comments, the project manager reports to the team member's boss that the team member is not cooperating. Which of the following is most likely the real problem?

A. The project manager did not get buy-in from the manager for the resources on the project.
B. The project manager did not create an adequate reward system for team members to improve their cooperation.
C. The project manager should have had a meeting with the team member's boss the first time the team member caused trouble.
D. The project manager did not assign work packages.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project manager is not losing resources (which is implied by not getting the manager's buy-in).
Although a reward system would help with cooperation, the real problem here is not cooperation. Meeting with the team member and his boss cannot be the answer because it also does not solve the problem at hand (the team member not knowing what he is to do). If you selected this choice, be very careful! You can get 10 to 20 questions wrong on the exam simply because you do not see the real problem! The whole discussion of the team member and his actions is a distractor. The real problem in this scenario is not that the team member is being uncooperative. He is asking a question that many team members want to ask in the real world. 'How can I tell you how things are going if I do not know what work I am being asked to do?' The real problem is the lack of a WBS and work packages. If there were a WBS and work packages for the project, the team member would not have to ask such a question.

Q119The cost performance index (CPI) on the project is 1.13, and the benefit-cost ratio is 1.2. The project scope was created by the team and stakeholders. Requirements have been changing throughout the project. No matter what the project manager has tried to accomplish in managing the project, which of the following is he most likely to face in the future?

A. Having to cut costs on the project and increase benefits
B. Making sure the customer has approved the project scope
C. Not being able to measure completion of the product of the project
D. Having to add resources to the project
Correct Answer: C
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
There are many pieces of data in this question that are distractors from the real issue. Though it is common to have to cut costs and add resources to a project, nothing in the question should lead you to think these will be required in this situation. Customers do not generally approve the project scope (what you are going to do to complete their requirements); instead, they approve the product scope (their requirements). Since requirements are used to measure the completion of the product of the project, not having complete requirements will make such measurement impossible.

Q121A highway renewal project you are managing appears to have some missing scope. Your understanding of the scope was that the highway was to be resurfaced. Now, one of the construction foremen has come to ask why he finds no mention of repainting the lines on the repaved road. He also wants to know if there are any guard rail replacement work packages in the project. You have seen some of the resurfaced road that is completed, with the new lines painted on them. Which of the following is most likely to have caused the misinterpretation of the project scope statement?

A. Imprecise language
B. Poor pattern, structure, and chronological order
C. Variations in size of work packages or detail of work
D. Too much detail
Correct Answer: A

Q122Which of the following is correct in regard to the Control Scope process?

A. Effective scope definition can lead to a more complete project scope statement.
B. The Control Scope process must be done before scope planning.
C. The Control Scope process must be integrated with other control processes.
D. Controlling the schedule is the most effective way of controlling scope.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Though it is correct that effective scope definition can lead to a more complete project scope statement, this cannot be the answer, because it does not deal with control. Scope planning occurs before the Control Scope process, not after it. Controlling the schedule is not the best way to control scope, so that is not the best answer. The control processes do not act in isolation. A change to one will most likely affect the others.
Therefore, the need to integrate the Control Scope process with other control processes is the best answer.

Answer: 



Q123Which of the following best describes the Validate Scope process?

A. It provides assurances that the deliverable meets the specifications, is an input to the project management plan, and is an output of Control Quality.
B. It ensures the deliverable is completed on time, ensures customer acceptance, and shows the deliverable meets specifications.
C. It ensures customer acceptance, shows the deliverable meets specifications, and provides a chance for differences of opinion to come to light.
D. It is an output of Control Quality, occurs before Define Scope, and ensures customer acceptance.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project management plan is completed before the Validate Scope process. The Validate Scope process does not deal with time, but rather with acceptance. The Validate Scope process does not occur before the Define Scope process. The choice stating that the Validate Scope process ensures customer acceptance, shows the deliverable meets specifications, and provides a chance for differences of opinion to come to light is entirely correct, making that the best answer.

Q124Which of the following best describes product analysis?

A. Working with the customer to determine the product description
B. Mathematically analyzing the quality desired for the project
C. Gaining a better understanding of the product of the project in order to create the project scope statement
D. Determining whether the quality standards on the project can be met Correct Answer: C
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
You need to have a product description before you can do product analysis. Analyzing the level of quality desired is related to the Plan Quality Management process. Determining whether the quality standards on the project can be met is done in the Manage Quality process. Product analysis includes gaining a better understanding of the product of the project in order to create the project scope statement.

Answer: 



Q125Which of the following best describes the difference between the Control Scope process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process?

A. Control Scope focuses on making changes to the product scope, and Perform Integrated Change Control focuses on making changes to integration.
B. Control Scope focuses on controlling the scope of the project, and Perform Integrated Change Control focuses on determining the impact of a change of scope on time, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer satisfaction.
C. Control Scope focuses on controlling the scope of the project, and Perform Integrated Change Control focuses on making changes to integration.
D. Control Scope focuses on making changes to the product scope, and Perform Integrated Change Control focuses on determining the impact of a change to scope, time, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer satisfaction.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Notice how the choices are similar to each other? Simply look at the first part of each choice 'Control Scope focuses on...' and see which version of the first part of the statement is correct. Then read the second part of each choice. The only statement that is entirely correct is: Control Scope focuses on controlling the scope of the project, and Perform Integrated Change Control focuses on determining the impact of a change of scope on time, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer satisfaction.

Q126The project was tasked to develop a new software to be used by three sales channels of an auto parts company. The project was consistently on time and within budget, and the stakeholders approved prototypes of the software. However, when the completed software was installed and beta tested, a problem was discovered. Although the software performed as expected on in-store and call center- assisted purchases, it was found to be incompatible with other software necessary to complete online transactions. Therefore, the customer refused to accept the final deliverable, and the team was left to find a new software package that would accommodate all the customer's needs.
Which of the following did the team not do?

A. Collect requirements from the right stakeholders.
B. Test interim deliverables.
C. Control stakeholder engagement.
D. Accurately define product scope.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Scope Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Based on the scenario presented, the team was aware of the high-level requirement that the software perform in all three sales channels. It seems that they had collected requirements from the right stakeholders, and accurately defined the scope. Somehow in the development of the software, an important requirement was overlooked, or was not properly developed. If the software had been tested in all three channels before it was delivered to the customer, the issue would have been identified, and the change control process to fix the problem would have been followed. Testing is an important aspect of the Control Scope process.

Q127A project manager is informed midway through project planning that she was given inaccurate data regarding new regulations affecting the required end date of her project. She may need to make a few adjustments, but she thinks she can still manage the project to complete it before the regulations take effect. She confirms this by analyzing the sequence of activities with the least amount of scheduling flexibility. What technique is she using?

A. Critical path method
B. Flowchart
C. Precedence diagramming
D. Work breakdown structure
Correct Answer: A
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
There are only two choices related to scheduling: critical path method and precedence diagramming.
Precedence diagramming is a diagramming technique that deals with the relationship between activities, not schedule flexibility. The project manager is analyzing the critical path.

Answer: 



Q128A design engineer is helping to ensure that the dependencies within her area of expertise are properly defined on the project. The design of several deliverables must be complete before manufacturing can begin. This is an example of what type of dependency?

A. Discretionary dependency
B. External dependency
C. Mandatory dependency
D. Scope dependency
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
No mention is made that the dependency comes from a source outside the project, so this is not an external dependency. Scope dependency is not a defined term. The key words in the question are 'must be complete.' Since the dependency is required, it could not be discretionary and therefore must be mandatory.
The question defines a mandatory dependency.

Answer: 



Q129Your sponsor and stakeholders have made it clear they wish to be kept informed on the project status. There are many aspects of the project on which you will report, and you want to choose the most appropriate tool to use in each case. Which of the following are generally illustrated better by bar charts than network diagrams?

A. Logical relationships
B. Critical paths
C. Resource trade-offs
D. Progress or status
Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The bar chart is designed to show a relationship to time. This is best used when demonstrating progress or status as a factor of time.

Q131Lag means:

A. The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project finish date
B. The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of its successor
C. Waiting time
D. The product of a forward and backward pass
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Total float and free float are the time an activity can be delayed without impacting the entire project or the next activity. A forward or backward pass refers to a network analysis technique, not waiting time. Waiting time is the correct definition of lag.

Answer: 



Q132A project manager is new to the company but has 10 years of project management experience. She is given a medium-sized project and is asked to plan so it is finished as quickly as possible because the company has a large list of projects to complete in the coming year. She will be given another project to manage as soon as she has this one baselined. She needs to report on the longest time the project will take. Which of the following is the best project management tool to use to determine this?

A. Work breakdown structure
B. Network diagram
C. Bar chart
D. Project charter
Correct Answer: B
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The bar chart may show an end date, but it is not used to determine dates. The project charter also may include a required end date but not a logical determination of how long the project will take. The network diagram shows dependencies between activities on the project activity list. The dependencies allow us to look at the various paths through the diagram to determine the longest duration (critical) path. The network diagram is the best answer.

Answer: 



Q133Which of the following is correct?

A. The critical path helps prove how long the project will take.
B. There can be only one critical path.
C. The network diagram will change every time the end date changes.
D. A project can never have negative float.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This question tests your knowledge about a number of topics. There can often be more than one critical path, but you might adjust the plan in order to decrease risk and have only one critical path. The network diagram may or may not change when the end date changes, depending on the amount of schedule reserve and the reason for the change to the schedule. You can have negative float if you are behind schedule. The critical path helps prove how long the project will take. This is the only correct statement of the choices given.

Answer: 



Q134A new project manager is walking you through the schedule she has created for her project. She asks you about the duration of a particular milestone, so she knows how to properly schedule it. What will you tell her about a milestones duration?

A. It is shorter than the duration of the longest activity.
B. It is shorter than the activity it represents.
C. It has no duration.
D. It is the same length as the activity it represents.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A milestone represents the completion of a series of activities or work packages. Milestones represent significant events within the project schedule. They are not work activities, and they have no duration

Answer: 



Q135Which of the following best describes the relationship between standard deviation and risk?

A. There is no relationship.
B. Standard deviation tells you if the estimate is accurate.
C. Standard deviation tells you how uncertain the estimate is.
D. Standard deviation tells you if the estimate includes a pad.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
An estimate can have a wide range and still be accurate if the item estimated includes identified risks.
There is no such thing as a pad in proper project management. An estimate might be inflated, but it is a calculated reserve to account for risks, not arbitrary padding. The standard deviation tells you the amount of uncertainty or risk involved in the estimate for the activity.

Answer: 



Q136The float of an activity is determined by:

A. Performing a Monte Carlo analysis
B. Determining the waiting time between activities
C. Determining lag
D. Determining the length of time the activity can be delayed without delaying the critical path Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The float of an activity is the length of time the activity can be delayed without delaying the critical path.

Answer: 



Q137To help them determine the schedule baseline, the team has drafted a network diagram. The project manager adds the time estimates for each activity to establish the critical path for the project. They discover the project has three critical paths. Which of the following best describes how this discovery will affect the project?

A. It makes it easier to manage.
B. It increases the project risk.
C. It requires more people.
D. It makes it more expensive.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Although having three critical paths could require more people or cost more, the answer that is always true is that it increases project risk. Because you need to manage three critical paths, there is more risk that something could happen to delay the project.

Q138The team is working on a project to develop or procure a customized software package that will be used by delivery drivers for a new chain of pizza restaurants. There are multiple stakeholders on this project. Because of other ongoing projects to design, build, and equip brick-and-mortar restaurant locations, you are informed that there is no rush to complete this software development work. If project time and cost are not as important as the number of resources used each month, which of the following is the best thing to do?

A. Perform a Monte Carlo analysis.
B. Fast track the project.
C. Perform resource optimization.
D. Analyze the life cycle costs.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Fast tracking affects both time and cost but may not help even out resource usage. Monte Carlo analysis and analysis of life cycle costs do not directly deal with resources. Resource optimization is the only choice that will definitely affect resources.

Answer: 



Q139You have identified a diverse group of stakeholders, and you will need to report information in a variety of ways to meet their different communications needs. When will you use a milestone chart instead of a bar chart?

A. Project planning
B. Reporting to team members
C. Reporting to management
D. Risk analysis
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Both types of charts are used in project planning. Team members need to see details, so they need a bar chart rather than a milestone chart. Risk analysis could make use of both charts. A milestone chart is used instead of a bar chart for any situation where you want to report in a less detailed way. Since bar charts can intimidate people with their complexity"and often show too much detail to be worthwhile on a management level"milestone charts are more effective for reporting to management.

Q140The organization is committed to rolling out a new cell phone accessory at an industry trade show in six months. The sponsor has made it clear that this product, to be created by your project team, must meet a long list of requirements, adhere to high quality standards, and, most importantly, be ready in time for the trade show. The sponsor has promised to commit as many resources as necessary for you to complete the project within these constraints. Your project management plan results in a project schedule that is too long. If the project network diagram cannot change but you have extra personnel resources, what is the best thing to do?

A. Fast track the project.
B. Level the resources.
C. Crash the project.
D. Perform Monte Carlo analysis.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Leveling resources generally extends the schedule. Monte Carlo analysis does not directly address the constraints of this situation. To compress the schedule, you could either crash or fast track. However, the situation says that the network diagram cannot change. This eliminates fast tracking, which leaves crashing the project as the best answer.

Answer: 



Q141Your team worked hard throughout project planning, thoroughly defining and estimating each activity required to complete the work. The resulting network diagram supported the end date that was approved by the team, management, and the stakeholders. As work has progressed, most milestones have been met. On two occasions, workarounds were needed to deal with the occurrence of unidentified risk events. With continued attention to detail, you have been successful in keeping the project on schedule and within budget. Now, an opportunity is identified that can only be realized if the project is completed two days ahead of schedule. Which of the following is the best thing to do when asked to complete a project two days earlier than planned?

A. Tell senior management that the project's critical path does not allow the project to be finished earlier.
B. Tell your manager.
C. Meet with the team to look at options for crashing or fast tracking the critical path.
D. Work hard and see what the project status is next month.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This is another question that asks about problem-solving. Neither telling your manager nor waiting to see the status next month will address the real problem. It would be inaccurate to report that the project cannot be finished earlier. Only meeting with the team to look for options for compressing the schedule (by crashing or fast tracking) relates to problem-solving.

Answer: 



Q142Although the customer agreed to the original project schedule, they are now asking for an earlier project finish. They are being pressured by their own customers. The project manager's sponsor thinks finishing early is not only a viable option but also a good idea for your organization because it will enable you to start another project sooner. In attempting to complete the project faster, the project manager looks at the cost associated with crashing each activity. The best approach to crashing would also include looking at the:

A. Risk impact of crashing each activity
B. Customer's opinion of which activities to crash
C. Sponsors opinion of which activities to crash and in what order
D. Project life cycle phase in which the activity is due to occur Correct Answer: A
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
You may or may not need your customer's or your sponsors input, but you will definitely need to include an analysis of risk.

Q144A project manager is in the middle of executing a large construction project when he discovers the time needed to complete the project is longer than the time available. What is the best thing to do?

A. Cut product scope.
B. Meet with management, and tell them the required date cannot be met.
C. Workovertime.
D. Determine options for schedule compression, and present management with the recommended option.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This question tests whether you know how to solve problems. Cutting product scope negatively affects the customer, and is therefore not best. A project managers job is to determine options for meeting any end date; therefore, simply telling management the required date cannot be met is not correct. Working overtime is expensive and unnecessary when there are many other choices that could be considered first.
Determining options for schedule compression would have the least negative effect on the project.

Answer: 



Q145During project planning, you estimate the time needed for each activity and then total the estimates to create the project estimate. You commit to completing the project by this date. What is wrong with this scenario?

A. The team did not create the estimate, and estimating takes too long using that method.
B. The team did not create the estimate, and a network diagram was not used.
C. The estimate is too long and should be created by management.
D. The project estimate should be the same as the customer's required completion date.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Time estimates for the activities should be created by the team and should not be added together to create the project estimate. Some activities may take place concurrently; these would be identified in the network diagram.

Answer: 



Q146You are a project manager on a $5,000,000 software development project. While working with your project team to develop a network diagram, you notice a series of activities that can be worked in parallel but must finish in a specific sequence. What type of activity sequencing method is required for these activities?

A. Precedence diagramming method
B. Arrow diagramming method
C. Critical path method
D. Operational diagramming method
Correct Answer: A
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The question implies a finish-to-finish relationship between activities. The arrow diagramming method is not a commonly used diagramming method, and it does not support that type of relationship. Critical path is not a diagramming method, and operational diagramming method is a made-up term. The precedence diagramming method is most appropriate in this case.

Answer: 



Q147You are a project manager on a US $5,000,000 software development project. While working with your project team to develop a network diagram, your data architects suggest that quality could be improved if the data model is approved by senior management before moving on to other design elements. They support this suggestion with an article from a leading software development journal. Which of the following best describes this type of input?

A. Mandatory external dependency
B. Discretionary external dependency
C. External regulatory dependency
D. Heuristic
Correct Answer: B
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A heuristic is a general rule that can be used consistently. This situation is a unique occurrence in which a preferred method is being suggested. Dependencies are often described with two terms, either mandatory or discretionary, and either internal or external. The input in this scenario is discretionary, as it is a suggestion, rather than a required method of doing the work. Since the input comes from a source outside the organization, it is considered external.

Q148Based on the following, if you needed to shorten the duration of the project, which activity would you try to shorten?
Preceding Duration
Activity Activity in Weeks
Start None 0
A Start 1
B Start 2
C Start 6
D A 10
E B, C 1
F C 2
G D 3
H E 9
I F 1
End G, H, I 0

A. Activity B
B. Activity D
C. Activity H
D. Activity C
Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This is an example of a two-stage question you may find on the exam. First you need to draw the network diagram and find the critical path, and then make a decision. The network diagram would be:
Paths Duration in Weeks
Start, A, D, G, End 14
Start, B, E, H, End 12
Start, C, E, H, End 16
Start, C, F, I, End 9
The critical path is 16 (Start, C, E, H, End). Many people immediately look for the longest duration activity on the project to cut. Here activity D is the longest, at 10 weeks. However, that activity is not on the critical path, and cutting it would not shorten the project's duration. You must change the critical path. In this case, both activity C and activity H are on the critical path. If you have a choice, all things being equal, choose the earlier option. Therefore, activity C is the best answer.

Answer: 



Q149You have a project with the following activities: Activity A takes 40 hours and can start after the project starts. Activity B takes 25 hours and should happen after the project starts. Activity C must happen after activity A and takes 35 hours. Activity D must happen after activities B and C and takes 30 hours. Activity E must take place after activity C and takes 10 hours. Activity F takes place after Activity E and takes 22 hours. Activities F and D are the last activities of the project. Which of the following is true if activity B actually takes 37 hours?

A. The critical path is 67 hours.
B. The critical path changes to Start, B, D, End.
C. The critical path is Start, A, C, E, F, End.
D. The critical path increases by 12 hours.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Did you notice how difficult this question was to read? Such wording is intentional"to prepare you for interpreting questions on the real exam. Looking at this situation, you see there are three paths through the network, as shown in the following table. If the duration of activity B changes from 25 to 37, the activity will take 12 hours longer. As the activity is only on the third path, it will only change the duration of that path from 55 to 55 + 12, or 67 hours. Since the duration of the critical path is 107 hours, the delay with activity B will have no impact on the project timeline or the current critical path.
Paths Duration in Hours
Start, A, C, E, F, End 107
Start, A, C, D, End 105
Start, B, D, End 55

Q150A project manager has received activity duration estimates from his team. Which of the following does he need in order to complete the Develop Schedule process?

A. Earned value analysis
B. Schedule change control system
C. Trend analysis
D. Reserves
Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The Develop Schedule process includes all work and uses all inputs needed to come up with a finalized, realistic schedule. As part of the Estimate Activity Durations process, reserves are created to cover identified and unknown schedule risks. All the other items are parts of Control Schedule and occur after the Develop Schedule process.

Answer: 



Q151A project manager is taking over a project from another project manager during project planning. If the new project manager wants to see what the previous project manager planned for managing changes to the schedule, it would be best to look at the:

A. Communications management plan
B. Update management plan
C. Staffing management plan
D. Schedule management plan
Correct Answer: D

Q153The WBS, estimates for each work package, and the network diagram are completed. The next thing for the project manager to do is:

A. Sequence the activities.
B. Validate that they have the correct scope.
C. Create a preliminary schedule and get the teams approval.
D. Complete risk management.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Sequencing the activities is the same thing as creating a network diagram, so that has already been done.
The Validate Scope process is done during project monitoring and controlling, not during project planning.
Since a schedule is an input to risk management, risk management comes after the creation of a preliminary schedule, and so that is not the next thing to do. Creating the preliminary schedule is next.

Answer: 



Q154A new product development project has four levels in the work breakdown structure and has been sequenced using the precedence diagramming method. The activity duration estimates have been received. What should be done next?

A. Create an activity list.
B. Begin the work breakdown structure.
C. Finalize the schedule.
D. Compress the schedule.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The question is really asking, 'What is done after the Estimate Activity Durations process?' The work breakdown structure and activity list are done before Estimate Activity Durations. The schedule is not finalized until after schedule compression. Therefore, compressing the schedule is done next.

Answer: 



Q155You are the project manager for a new product development project that has four levels in the work breakdown structure. The network diagram and duration estimates have been created, and a schedule has been developed and compressed. Which schedule management activity should you do next?

A. Control the schedule.
B. Determine dependencies.
C. Analogously estimate the schedule.
D. Gain approval.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Notice how this question and the previous one seem similar. This is intended to prepare you for similar questions on the exam. Determining dependencies and analogously estimating the schedule should have already been completed. The situation described is within the Develop Schedule process of schedule management. Control Schedule is the next schedule management process after Develop Schedule, but the Develop Schedule process is not yet finished. Final approval of the schedule by the stakeholders is needed before one has a project schedule.

Q156A team member from research and development tells you that her work is too creative to provide you with a fixed single estimate for the activity. You both decide to use the average labor hours (from past, similar projects) to develop a prototype. This is an example of which of the following?

A. Parametric estimating
B. Three-point estimating
C. Analogous estimating
D. Monte Carlo analysis
Correct Answer: A
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Monte Carlo analysis is a modeling, or simulation, technique. Three-point estimating uses three time estimates per activity. One could use data from past projects to come up with the estimate (analogous estimating), but the best answer is parametric estimating because history is being used to calculate an estimate.

Answer: 



Q157As part of a project managers due diligence, he reviews the schedule, focusing on each activity as its start time approaches. He also monitors activities as they progress. He is currently looking at an activity that has an early start (ES) of day 3, a late start (LS) of day 13, an early finish (EF) of day 9, and a late finish (LF) of day 19. In all likelihood, this activity:

A. Is on the critical path
B. Has a lag
C. Is progressing well
D. Is not on the critical path
Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
There is no information presented about lag or progress. The activity described has float because there is a difference between the early start and late start. An activity that has float is probably not on the critical path.

Answer: 



Q158The project is calculated to be completed four days after the desired completion date. You do not have access to additional resources. The project is low risk, the benefit-cost ratio is expected to be 1.6, and the dependencies are preferential. Under these circumstances, what is the best thing to do?

A. Cut resources from an activity.
B. Make more activities concurrent.
C. Move resources from the preferential dependencies to the external dependencies.
D. Remove an activity from the project.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Cutting resources from an activity would not save time, nor would moving resources from the preferential dependencies to the external dependencies. Removing an activity from the project is a possibility, but because the dependencies are preferential and the risk is low, the best choice is to make more activities concurrent, as this would have less impact on the project.

Q160Senior management is complaining that they are not able to easily determine the status of ongoing projects in the organization. Which of the following types of reports would help provide summary information to senior management?

A. Detailed cost estimates
B. Project management plans
C. Barcharts
D. Milestone reports
Correct Answer: D
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Detailed cost estimates have nothing to do with the situation described. Project management plans include more detail than is necessary for the situation described, and may distract from the conversation if used in this situation. Bar charts are most effective for reporting to the team. The best answer is milestone reports, which present the right level of detail for upper management.

Q162The team is helping the project manager estimate activities on their project. They are experienced and skilled, and many members have been with the company for some time. There are several activities they need to estimate that have not been previously done by the company. What is the best method of estimating these activities?

A. Analogous estimating
B. Three-point estimating
C. Monte Carlo analysis
D. Parametric estimating
Correct Answer: B
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Analogous estimating can be used when you have done similar work previously. Monte Carlo analysis is a schedule development technique. Parametric estimating includes the use of history and productivity rates for the work, which would not be available if you had not done the activity before. Three-point estimating is the best method to use in this case because it allows you to estimate in a range"optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely.

Q163During project executing, a large number of changes are made to the project. Several of the change requests have come from the customer, significantly changing the functionality of the originally requested product. Six project team members have been reassigned by management to a higher- priority project, and they have been replaced. As project work has progressed, many of the identified risks have occurred and have been successfully mitigated. However, three contingency plans have been adjusted and will be implemented if identified risks recur during the remainder of the project. The project manager should:

A. Wait until all changes are known, and then print out a new schedule.
B. Make sure the project charter is still valid.
C. Change the schedule baseline.
D. Talk to management before any changes are made.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Schedule Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Waiting until all changes are known and then printing out a new schedule is a common error many project managers make. Instead, the project manager should be controlling the project throughout its completion.
The situation in the question does not provide a reason to believe the schedule baseline must be changed.
A project manager must be in control of the project, rather than consulting with management before making any changes. Whenever a large number of changes occur on a project, it is wise to confirm that the business case, as stated in the project charter, is still valid.

Q165The finance department requires that you keep them updated on the costs being spent on the capital project you are leading. You were required to submit a funding plan, and monthly forecasts are necessary so that any changes to the funding plan can be requested in advance and evaluated. Exceeding the budget limit is unacceptable, as it will impact the stock value. You have successfully implemented processes and practices to anticipate funding changes, and you evaluate them to minimize problems and increase the efficient use of funds. You have employed a variety of reporting and analysis techniques to meet the finance department requirements. One of them is EAC, which is a periodic evaluation of:

A. The cost of work completed
B. The value of work performed
C. The anticipated total cost at project completion
D. What it will cost to finish the project
Correct Answer: C
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
When you look at earned value, many of the terms have similar definitions. This could get you into trouble.
EAC means the estimate at completion. What it will cost to finish the project is the definition of ETC, or estimate to complete.

B. -75
C. 400
D. -50
Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The formula is CV = EV - AC. Therefore, CV = 350 - 400, or CV = -50. PV is not a factor in this calculation.

Q167The customer responsible for overseeing your project asks you to provide a written cost estimate that is 30 percent higher than your estimate of the projects cost. He explains that the budgeting process requires managers to estimate pessimistically to ensure enough money is allocated for projects. What is the best way to handle this?

A. Add the 30 percent as a lump sum contingency fund to handle project risks.
B. Add the 30 percent to your cost estimate by spreading it evenly across all project activities.
C. Create one cost baseline for budget allocation and a second one for the actual project management plan.
D. Ask for information on risks that would cause your estimate to be too low.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Presenting anything other than your original estimate (allocating more to the budget) is inaccurate and calls into question your competence and integrity as a project manager. The customer should list potential changes and risks related to your estimate. If the costs and risks are justified, you can ethically increase the budget.

Q168You've recently been assigned to manage a marketing project to brand a sustainable development program. Even though you are just starting your efforts, the sponsors are concerned about the likelihood of reaching planned milestones during the project. They are wondering how you will go about estimating.
Analogous estimating:

A. Uses bottom-up estimating techniques
B. Is used most frequently during project executing
C. Uses top-down estimating techniques
D. Calculates estimates using actual detailed historical costs
Correct Answer: C
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Analogous estimating is used most frequently during project initiating and planning, not project executing.
Parametric estimating involves calculations based on historical records. Analogous estimating early in the project uses top-down estimating techniques.

Q169You have been working with the subject matter experts to estimate the activity durations and costs on the project. All the following are outputs of the Estimate Costs process except:

A. An understanding of the cost risk in the work that has been estimated
B. The prevention of inappropriate changes from being included in the cost baseline
C. An indication of the range of possible costs for the project
D. Documentation of any assumptions made during the Estimate Costs process Correct Answer: B
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This question is asking, 'When you finish estimating costs, what do you have?' Many people who do not realize that estimates should be in a range choose that option. Documentation of assumptions is included in the basis of estimates, which is an output of Estimate Costs. The prevention of inappropriate changes is more correctly part of the cost management plan and the change control system.

Q170The product your project team is working on is a replacement of a device the company launched a couple of years ago. That device did not meet market projections for sales, even though it was revolutionary in its capabilities. The reason it did not meet projections was that the life cycle costing was not fully considered and analyzed during the device development. When the original device was offered to the market, it had initial success until a trade publication analyzed the life cycle costs and determined they were unreasonably high. Sales lagged due to the negative reports. Internal tests showed that the trade publication was correct. This time the team is taking life cycle costs into consideration as they develop the product. The main focus of life cycle costing is to:

A. Estimate installation costs.
B. Estimate the cost of operations and maintenance.
C. Consider installation costs when planning the project costs.
D. Consider operations and maintenance costs in making project decisions.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

Q171You're managing a project to develop a new mobile application for the inventory-tracking-and-control system of a restaurant franchise organization. Schedule is the highest-priority constraint for the leadership team, but the franchise owners are most concerned about cost and the quality of the application. If there are bugs and errors in the system, they will pay higher costs on waste or lost sales. But investing a lot of effort into delivering great functionality could be expensive. It was decided that an adaptive approach to the project life cycle would likely be the best way to balance the competing priorities and deliver a working, cost- effective application. The franchise decision team has been meeting with the development team. The groups feel good about the project's progress, but they are hearing concerns from other stakeholders about what the impact will be to the bottom line and whether the system will be ready for launch. These concerns were anticipated in planning, and will be managed with cost performance measurement. Cost performance measurement is best done through which of the following?

A. Asking for a percent complete from each team member and reporting that in the monthly progress report
B. Calculating earned value, and using indexes and other calculations to report past performance and forecast future performance
C. Using the 50/50 rule, and making sure the life cycle cost is less than the project cost
D. Focusing on the amount expended last month and what will be expended the following month Correct Answer: B
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Asking percent complete is not a best practice since it is usually a guess. If the easiest work is done first on a project, it can throw off any percentage calculations of work remaining. The life cycle cost cannot be lower than the project cost, as the life cycle cost includes the project cost. Focusing on the amount spent last month and what will be spent in the next month is often done by inexperienced project managers. Not only does this provide little information, but the data cannot be used to predict the future. Earned value analysis and other calculations is the best answer since this choice looks at the past and uses that information to estimate future costs.

Q173The teams attitude toward the project is very positive. They are excited about the research and development work they are doing. The value of the work completed today is $60 million. The potential consumers from the product testing and focus groups have stated 'the product will be amazing' and 'they would absolutely buy it.' The phase gate review board has received the reports and is asking for market projections and launch plans. They are wondering when this product can start returning value to the organization. The project is budgeted to cost $77 million. The value of the work planned to be done to this point is $78.9 million. What does the schedule performance index (SPI) for this project tell you?

A. You are over budget.
B. You are ahead of schedule.
C. You are progressing at 76 percent of the rate originally planned.
D. You are progressing at 24 percent of the rate originally planned.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This earned value question is asking you to calculate the schedule performance index (SPI) and interpret the results. The formula for SPI is EV/PV. The EV in this question is the estimated value of the work already completed, or $60 million. The planned value, the estimated value of the work planned to be done is $78.9 million. Therefore SPI = $60/$78.9 = 0.76. This tells you the project is progressing at 76 percent of the rate planned.

Q174The project management team is busy breaking down deliverables, and the procurement department has started looking for possible sellers to help produce the deliverables. There are departmental concerns that the project could go over budget because the scope will be iterated and the planning and development will be done in increments. At a recent company gathering, the sponsor asked questions of the project manager and the project management staff team about how changes in scope will affect the estimates. The sponsor wanted to know how the project estimates could be relied upon, given that they were planning to iterate the scope. The project manager reassured them that the team has the right tools with which to provide accurate estimates, and will utilize the tools throughout the project. Which of the following is not needed in order to come up with a project estimate?

A. A WBS
B. A network diagram
C. Risks
D. Change requests
Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
You need the WBS to define the activities, the network diagram to see the dependencies, and the risks to determine contingencies. NOTE: These are high-level risks, not the detailed risks that are identified later in project planning. Change requests are not required to obtain estimates, although they could cause existing estimates to be adjusted. Without the other three choices, you cannot develop good estimates.

Q177For each activity on your project, you have worked with designers, engineers, technical experts, and consultants to come up with details on the resources needed to complete the activity. For some of the activities the lists are quite long, as you need raw and finished materials, equipment, and people. You have a limited amount of warehousing available, so you have to coordinate the deliveries and work so that the materials and equipment are delivered as close to the start of an activity as possible. You and the project management team have identified the amount of time and money needed for each of the activities, which you have then aggregated and analyzed with their help. These efforts will eventually result in the creation of a cost baseline for the project. A senior manager is trying to better understand the work of project management and has asked which process produces the cost baseline. What is the correct response?

Q186You are leading a project to introduce a new healthcare appointment scheduling application. As you are creating plans detailing how the team will respond to possible events that may impact the project, you and the team determine the amount of cost contingency reserve needed. The cost contingency reserve should
be:

A. Hidden to prevent management from disallowing the reserve
B. Added to each activity to provide the customer with a shorter critical path
C. Maintained by management to cover cost overruns
D. Added to the cost of the project to account for risks
Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Hiding the reserve is an inappropriate action. Adding cost to each activity will not shorten the critical path, and is an incorrect statement. Management reserves, not contingency reserves, are maintained by management to cover cost overruns. During the risk management process, you determine appropriate contingency reserves to cover the cost of identified risks. These costs are included in the project cost baseline.

Q188Your cost forecast shows you will have a cost overrun at the end of the project. Which of the following should you do?

A. Eliminate risks in estimates and reestimate.
B. Meet with the sponsor to find out what work can be done sooner.
C. Cut quality.
D. Decrease scope.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Look for the choice that would have the least negative impact on this situation. You would not need to meet with the sponsor to determine which work can be done sooner, and changing the order of activities is unlikely to eliminate the cost overrun. Cutting quality and decreasing scope always have negative effects.
The choice with the least negative impact is to eliminate risks in estimates and reestimate.

Answer: 



Q189Early in the life of your project, you are having a discussion with the sponsor about what estimating techniques should be used. You want a form of expert judgment, but the sponsor argues for analogous estimating. It would be best to:

A. Agree to analogous estimating, as it is a form of expert judgment.
B. Suggest life cycle costing as a compromise.
C. Determine why the sponsor wants such an accurate estimate.
D. Try to convince the sponsor to allow expert judgment because it is typically more accurate.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This is a tricky question. Determining why the sponsor wants such an accurate estimate sounds like a good idea at first. However, analogous estimates are less accurate than other forms of estimating, as they are prepared with a limited amount of detailed information. Reading every word of this choice helps eliminate it.
To pick the best answer, you need to realize that analogous estimating is a form of expert judgment.

Q190You have just completed the initiating processes of a small project and are moving into project planning when a project stakeholder asks you for the projects budget and cost baseline. What should you tell her?

A. The project budget can be found in the project charter, which has just been completed.
B. The project budget and baseline will not be finalized and accepted until the planning processes are completed.
C. The project management plan will not contain the projects budget and baseline; this is a small project.
D. It is impossible to complete an estimate before the project management plan is created.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The overall project budget may be included in the project charter but not the detailed costs. Even small projects should have a budget and schedule. It is not impossible to create a project budget before the project management plan is created. However, it is not wise to do so, as the budget will not be accurate.
The project budget and baseline are not finalized and accepted until the planning processes are completed.

Answer: 



Q191The project manager is working with cost estimates in order to establish a baseline for measuring project performance. What process is this?

A. Cost Management
B. Estimate Costs
C. Determine Budget
D. Control Costs
Correct Answer: C
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Cost Management is too general. The estimates are already created in this situation, so the answer is not Estimate Costs. The answer is not Control Costs, because the baseline has not yet been created. The work described is the Determine Budget process.

Answer: 



Q192Monitoring cost expended to date in order to detect variances from the plan occurs during:

A. The creation of the cost change control system
B. Recommending corrective actions
C. Updating the cost baseline
D. Project performance reviews
Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Recommending corrective actions and possible updates to the cost baseline result from project performance reviews; they are not concurrent with them. Monitoring costs is part of change control, but not part of creating the change control system. The correct choice is project performance reviews.

Answer: 



Q193You're thinking through what approach will make it easiest for the team to take responsibility for providing work performance data for all aspects of the project. As part of this approach, you believe it will be helpful to make sure the team understands how and why the data will be analyzed. You explain to the team that the cost management plan contains a description of:

A. The project costs
B. How resources are allocated
C. The budgets and how they were calculated
D. The WBS level at which earned value will be calculated
Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management

Q194A manufacturing project has a schedule performance index (SPI) of 0.89 and a cost performance index (CPI) of 0.91. Generally, what is the most likely explanation for why this occurred?

A. The scope was changed.
B. A supplier went out of business, and a new one needed to be found.
C. Additional equipment needed to be purchased.
D. A critical path activity took longer and needed more labor hours to complete.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
To answer this question, you must look for a choice that would take longer and cost more. Notice one of the choices says scope was changed, but that does not necessarily mean it was added to. If the change was to reduce the scope, it might also have reduced cost. Although it would take time to handle the issue of the need to find a new supplier, the impacted activity might not be on the critical path and might not affect time.
Purchasing additional equipment definitely adds cost, but not necessarily time. A critical path activity taking longer and requiring more labor hours to complete would negatively affect both time and cost.

Answer: 



Q195Although the stakeholders thought there was enough money in the budget, halfway through the project the cost performance index (CPI) is 0.7. To determine the root cause, several stakeholders audit the project and discover the project cost budget was estimated analogously. Although the activity estimates add up to the project estimate, the stakeholders think something was missing in how the estimate was completed.
Which of the following describes what was missing?

A. Estimated costs should be used to measure CPI.
B. SPI should be used, not CPI.
C. Bottom-up estimating should have been used.
D. Past history was not taken into account.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Actual costs are used to measure CPI, and there is no reason to use SPI in this situation. Using past history is another way of saying 'analogous.' The most detailed way to estimate is bottom-up. Such estimating would have improved the overall quality of the activity estimates.

Q196In analyzing problems that have occurred during testing, the team discovered that cause-and-effect diagramming is helpful in identifying the best place to focus their efforts. Their coordination of the interrelationships of the deliverables has improved, and the team has discovered efficiencies that have been shared with other projects and the organization for process improvement. This has made a difference in how well the project is aligning to the performance measurement baseline. Stakeholders are anticipating that control efforts and reporting on future projects will be easier. Earned value analysis is the basis for:

A. Performance reporting
B. Planning control
C. Ishikawa diagrams
D. Integrating the project components into a whole
Correct Answer: A
Section: Cost Management

Q197The replacement of the inventory management and portion control system for an international restaurant chain has been prioritized as a key strategic objective for the organization. Stakeholders are very concerned about many aspects of the project. They have shared these concerns and ideas in workshops, focus groups, emails, and surveys. Identified risks are:

A. An input to the Estimate Costs process
B. An output of the Estimate Costs process
C. Not related to the Estimate Costs process
D. Both an input to and an output of the Estimate Costs process Correct Answer: D
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

Identified risks are listed in the risk register, an input to the Estimate Costs process. In completing the Estimate Costs process, additional risks may be uncovered. These are added to the risk register as project documents updates.

Answer: 



Q198There is confusion among some of the stakeholders about how the cost forecasts will be calculated on the project. They also have concerns about whether enough money has been set aside to cover the cost of risk responses. You are planning to share information in the upcoming team meeting and in reports to stakeholders to clear up the confusion. You are referencing the stakeholder and communications management plans to determine how best to communicate with the stakeholders. You will explain that the difference between the cost baseline and the cost budget can be best described as:

A. The management reserves
B. The contingency reserves
C. The project cost estimate
D. The cost account
Correct Answer: A
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The costs of activities are included in the project cost estimate, and the contingency reserves (to cover identified risks) are added to that to come up with the cost baseline. Thereafter, the management reserves (to cover unknown, or unidentified, risks) are added to come up with the cost budget. The management reserves make up the difference between the cost baseline and the cost budget.

Q199You provide a project cost estimate for the project to the project sponsor. He is unhappy with the estimate, because he thinks the price should be lower. He asks you to cut 15 percent off the project estimate. What should you do?

A. Start the project and constantly look for cost savings.
B. Tell all the team members to cut 15 percent from their estimates.
C. Inform the sponsor of the activities to be cut.
D. Add additional resources with low hourly rates.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
To answer the question, you must first realize that it is never appropriate for a project manager to just cut estimates across the board. You should have created a project estimate based on realistic work package estimates that do not include padding. Then, if costs must be decreased, you can look to cut quality, decrease risk, cut scope, or use cheaper resources (and at the same time closely monitor the impact of changes on the project schedule).
One of the worst things a project manager can do is to start a project knowing that the schedule or cost for the project is unrealistic. Did you notice the choice of adding additional resources? Even though they have lower hourly rates, that would add cost. Evaluating, looking for alternatives, and then reporting the impact of cost cutting to the sponsor is the best action to take.

Q200Cost risk means:

A. There are risks that will cost the project money.
B. The project is too risky from a cost perspective.
C. There is a risk that project costs could go higher than planned.
D. There is a risk that the cost of the project will be lower than planned.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Cost Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
While it is true that risk will cost the project money, that is not the definition of cost risk. Stating that the project is too risky from a cost perspective assumes the risk is too great to do the project. Cost risk is the risk that project costs could go higher than planned.

Answer:

Q202When a product or service completely meets a customer's requirements:

A. Quality is achieved.
B. The cost of quality is high.
C. The cost of quality is low.
D. The customer pays the minimum price.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
As a general rule, one cannot say that quality (as defined in the question) is either of high or low cost.
Quality provides what the customer wanted, which may not be the highest or lowest cost. When a product or service completely meets a customer's needs, quality is achieved.

Answer:

Q205A project has faced major difficulties in the quality of its deliverables. Management now states that quality is the most important project constraint. If another problem with quality were to occur, what would be the best thing for the project manager to do?

A. Fix the problem as soon as possible.
B. Allow the schedule to slip by cutting cost.
C. Allow cost to increase by fixing the root cause of the problem.
D. Allow risk to increase by cutting cost.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
If a problem with quality were to occur again, many people would opt to fix the problem as soon as possible.
It is proactive, but some other project constraint(s) must change to accommodate fixing the root cause of the problem. It may not be necessary to allow the schedule to slip, because the project manager might be able to compress the schedule in other areas. Cutting cost does not necessarily cause the schedule to slip, nor would that necessarily fix the problem at hand. Allowing risk to increase by cutting cost is not the best choice, because a quality problem is most likely to create additional cost, rather than cut cost. Allowing the cost to increase by fixing the root cause of the problem addresses both the need to find the cause and the probable impact of dealing with the problem.

Answer: 



Q206A manager notices that a project manager is holding a meeting with some of the team and some stakeholders to discuss the quality of the project. The project schedule has been compressed, and the CPI is 1.1. The team has worked hard on the project and has been rewarded according to the reward system the project manager put in place. Overall, there is a strong sense of team. The manager suggests that the project manager does not have enough time to hold meetings about quality when the schedule is so compressed. Which of the following best describes why the manager is wrong?

A. Improved quality leads to increased productivity, increased cost effectiveness, and decreased cost risk.
B. Improved quality leads to increased productivity, decreased cost effectiveness, and increased cost risk.
C. Improved quality leads to increased productivity, increased cost effectiveness, and increased cost risk.
D. Improved quality leads to increased productivity, decreased cost effectiveness, and decreased cost risk.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Did you notice there is a lot of data not relevant to answering the question? Expect distractors to appear in many questions on the exam. Quality efforts should produce a decrease rather than an increase in cost risk as a result of less rework. Quality efforts should also provide increased cost effectiveness due to less rework. This leaves the best answer: 'Improved quality leads to increased productivity, increased cost effectiveness, and decreased cost risk.'

Q221You are a project manager for a major information systems project. Someone from the quality department comes to see you about beginning a quality audit of your project. The team, already under pressure to complete the project as soon as possible, objects to the audit. You should explain to the team that the purpose of a quality audit is:

A. To check whether measurements of project deliverables are within specification limits
B. To check if the customer is following the quality process
C. To identify inefficient and ineffective policies
D. To check the accuracy of costs submitted by the team
Correct Answer: C
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Control charts show whether measurements of project deliverables are within specification limits, and are used in the Control Quality process. The seller cannot generally control or review the customer's quality process. Checking the accuracy of costs submitted by the team is more representative of a cost audit than a quality audit, so that option cannot be the best choice. Manage Quality, of which an audit is part, focuses on processes, procedures, and standards. One purpose of a quality audit is to identify inefficient and ineffective policies.

What should you do in this situation?

A. Assure senior management that during the Plan Quality Management process, it was determined that the project would meet the quality standards.
B. Analogously estimate future results.
C. Involve the quality team.
D. Check the results from the last quality management plan.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Assuring management that it was determined in planning that the project would meet quality standards is not productive, since it does not solve the problem. An analogous estimate looks at the past history of other projects. This would not be appropriate to determine how the current project is going. The quality management plan does not provide results. The quality team could help to determine whether the team is following the correct process to satisfy the relevant quality standards.

Q225A project manager has just taken over the project from another project manager during project executing. The previous project manager created a project budget, determined communications requirements, and went on to the complete work packages task. What should the new project manager do next?

A. Coordinate completion of work packages.
B. Identify quality standards.
C. Begin the Identify Risks process.
D. Validate scope.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Completion of work packages is done after project planning. Since Validate Scope is a monitoring and controlling process, that is not next. Identify Risks sounds like a good choice; however, identifying quality standards occurs before the Identify Risks process. You may have misread the question and assumed communication planning was complete, but notice it only says that communications requirements have been determined. Communications planning still needs to be completed, as do other aspects of planning.
Identify quality standards is the best answer choice offered.

Q227At the end of the project, the project manager reports that the project has added four unexpected areas of functionality and three areas of performance. The customer has expressed satisfaction with the project.
What does this mean in terms of the success of the project?

A. The project was an unqualified success.
B. The project was unsuccessful because it was gold plated.
C. The project was unsuccessful because the customer being happy means they would have paid more for the work.
D. The project was successful because the team had a chance to learn new areas of functionality and the customer was satisfied.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Quality Management

Q229The project manager notices that the project activities being completed by one department are all taking slightly longer than planned. To date, none of the activities in the work packages have been on the critical path. The project manager is bothered by the problem, since four of the next five critical path activities are being completed by this department.
After making three calls, the project manager is finally able to talk with the department manager to determine what is going on. The conversation is slow because both speak different native languages, and they are trying to converse in French, a shared language. To make communication easier, the project manager frequently asks the department manager to repeat back what has been said. The department manager communicates that his staff is following a company policy that requires two levels of testing. During the conversation, the department manager also makes a comment that leads the project manager to believe the policy may include excessive work. This is the fourth time the project manager has heard such a comment. What is the best thing to do?

A. Create a better communications management plan that requires one universal language on the project and have translators readily available on a moment's notice.
B. Contact someone else in the department who speaks the project manager's native language better to confirm the department manager's opinion.
C. Find out if the upcoming activities should be reestimated.
D. Work on increasing the effectiveness of the performing organization by recommending continuous improvement of the policy in question.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Changing the communications management plan may not be needed, and it does not deal with the problem at hand"the policy that is slowing things down. Confirming the department manager's opinion with someone else in the department is not the best choice, as the project manager already has heard the opinion on many other occasions. It is already confirmed. Determining whether upcoming activities should be reestimated is just being reactive. A good project manager will find the root cause and deal with that, even if it means attempting to improve the company's policies and processes. Yes, recommending improvement of the policy is the best answer. This is continuous improvement. Because there are several activities affected by the policy, it would best serve the project to get to the root cause of the problem and solve it.

Q230As the project manager, you are preparing your quality management plan. You are looking for a tool that can demonstrate the relationship between events and their resulting effects. You want to use this tool to depict the events that cause a negative effect on quality. Which of the following is the best choice for accomplishing your objective?

A. Scatter diagram
B. Pareto diagram
C. Why-why diagram
D. Control chart
Correct Answer: C
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
All reports and diagrams are communications tools. This question asks you to pick the most appropriate quality tool to help communications. A why-why diagram, also called a cause-and- effect or Ishikawa diagram, is more appropriate than a Pareto diagram since you are trying to determine the causes. Once causes are known and you have data on occurrences, the data can be displayed in a Pareto diagram.

Q231Which of the following explains why quality should be planned in and not inspected in?

A. It reduces quality and is less expensive.
B. It improves quality and is more expensive.
C. It reduces quality and is more expensive.
D. It improves quality and is less expensive.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Look for the proactive approach. When we plan for quality, we define the appropriate level of quality needed, which will improve quality overall and will likely be less expensive in the long run. NOTE: You may spend more initially on determining the right level of quality and doing the work to produce the required level of quality, but you will save through reduced rework, waste, and scrap.

Q232Work on a project is ongoing when the project manager overhears two workers arguing over what a set of instructions means. The project manager investigates and discovers that the instructions for the construction of the concrete footings currently being poured were poorly translated between the different languages in use on the project. Which of the following is the best thing for the project manager to do first?

A. Get the instructions translated by a more experienced party.
B. Look for quality impacts of the poor translation of the instructions for the footings.
C. Bring the issue to the attention of the team, and ask them to look for other translation problems.
D. Inform the sponsor of the problem in the next project report.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Although all these choices are correct things to do, the question asks what to do first. What is the most immediate problem? Getting the instructions translated by a more experienced party could be done, but it does not address the critical concern of the footings that have already been poured according to the poorly translated instructions. Asking the team to look for other translation issues is an excellent idea. However, it does not address the immediate problem. Informing the sponsor is also not taking action to solve the problem. Isn't it most urgent to find out whether the concrete footings meet your project requirements? Are they adequate? Only the option of looking for quality impacts of the poor translation will help you determine that.

D. Logical data model
Correct Answer: A
Section: Quality Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Interviews are used in Plan Quality Management to identify existing standards, processes, and metrics"or to create new ones. A logical data model is also used in Plan Quality Management. Its purpose is to help the team understand the requirements, and define the appropriate quality management processes. Checksheets are used in Control Quality to track data such as the type and frequency of quality problems uncovered during inspections. Cause-and-effect diagrams are used in Manage Quality to confirm that the policies, procedures, and metrics are adequate to produce the required level of quality in project deliverables. In Control Quality, cause-and-effect diagrams can be used to uncover the root cause of a variation in the quality of deliverables.

Q239The replacement of an important legacy system in the organization will be challenging because there are offices in seven countries, and the business operations cannot be interrupted. Your objective is to have the system updated before new regulations go into effect in one of the participating countries. There are many opinions on how the system should be changed. Some stakeholders are expecting that the new system will encompass more capabilities than the current system. Both internal team members and consultants will be involved in making the hardware and software changes. The sponsor is hoping to keep costs down by using organizational team members to perform the testing and installation activities. You are defining the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders on the project. The sponsors role on a project is best described as:

A. Helping to plan activities
B. Helping to prevent unnecessary changes to project objectives
C. Identifying unnecessary project constraints
D. Helping to develop the project management plan
Correct Answer: B
Section: Resource Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Although the sponsor may help plan some of the activities, it is not their exclusive duty. Some project constraints come from the sponsor, but they should be considered necessary. The project management plan is created with the team and approved by the sponsor and other management. Since the project objectives are stated in the project charter, and it is the sponsor who issues the project charter, helping to prevent unnecessary changes to project objectives is the correct answer.

Q242Two stakeholders are disagreeing via a series of emails as to whether a deliverable meets the acceptance criteria. One of the stakeholders wanted different criteria, but the cost-benefit analysis done in planning did not support delivering that level of performance. The stakeholders agreed that the higher level of performance was not required and was not cost effective. A team member has just informed you that a problem with her work has occurred. The deliverable she is working on must be shipped today, or there will be a project breach. One of the stakeholders having the email disagreement comes to you to complain about the other.

The third team member agrees with both of them. How should the project manager best deal with the conflict?

A. She should listen to the differences of opinion, determine the best choice, and implement that choice.
B. She should postpone further discussions, meet with each individual, and determine the best approach.
C. She should listen to the differences of opinion, encourage logical discussions, and facilitate an agreement.

Q254A project is in the middle of the executing effort when a stakeholder suggests a change that would result in the third major overhaul of the project. At the same time, the project manager discovers that a large work package was not completed because a team member's manager moved her to another project that had a higher priority. Of the following, who is the best person for the project manager to address these issues with?

A. The team
B. Senior management
C. The customer
D. The sponsor
Correct Answer: D
Section: Resource Management

Q255The installation project has a CPI of 1.03 and an SPI of 1.0. There are 14 team members, and each team member had input into the final project management plan. The customer has accepted the three deliverables completed so far without complaint, and the responsibility assignment matrix has not changed since the project began. The project is being completed in a matrix environment, and there are no contracts needed for the project.
Although the sponsor is happy with the status of the project, one of the team members is always complaining about how much time his project work is taking. Which of the following is the best thing for the project manager to do?

A. Review the reward system for the project.
B. Try to improve schedule performance of the project.
C. Meet with the customer to try to extend the schedule.
D. Gain formal acceptance in writing from the customer.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Resource Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Improving schedule performance relates to getting the project completed sooner. Although it would seem to be a good idea to improve schedule performance, this projects performance is fine. The schedule has been approved as it is. It would be better for the project manager to spend more time controlling the project to make sure it finishes according to plan than to improve schedule performance.
If you chose attempting to extend the schedule, look at the SPI. There is nothing wrong with the schedule performance of the project that would require an extension. Gaining formal acceptance from the customer will need to be done, as it provides an opportunity for the team to check if everything is going well. This action will not affect the team member's dissatisfaction, however.
The only real problem presented in this situation is that the team member is complaining. If you read the question completely, you will notice that the team member was involved in creating and approving the project management plan, which included details about his own involvement in the project. Because the responsibility assignment matrix has not changed, the team member has not even been assigned different duties since the project began. There must be something else causing the team member to complain. The project manager should investigate and find out if the reward system is ineffective.

Q256The project has been challenging to manage. Everyone has been on edge due to pressure to complete the project on time. Unfortunately, the tension has grown to the point where team meetings have become shouting matches, with little work accomplished during the meetings. One team member asks to be excused from future team meetings, as all the shouting upsets him. Meanwhile, the sponsor has expressed interest in attending future team meetings to hear how the project is going and to better understand the issues involved in completing the project. In addition, the customer has started discussions about adding scope to the project. In this situation, it would be best for the project manager to:

A. Ask the sponsor if the information needed could be sent in a report rather than have her attend the meetings.
B. Inform the team member who asked to be excused from the meetings of the value of communication in such meetings.
C. Involve the team in creating ground rules for the meetings.
D. Hold a team-building exercise that involves all the team members.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Resource Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Here is a situation in which all four choices could be done, but there is one best answer. Asking the sponsor if the information could be sent in a report does not solve the root cause of the problem described.
Informing the team member of the value of communication in meetings merely dismisses the concerns of the team member. A team-building exercise would take planning, so it could not be done right away.
Remember, the sponsor might be attending the next meeting, and at least one team member might not attend because of past problems. The best thing to do would be to set up new ground rules governing team behavior and then plan a team-building exercise.

Q259The project cost performance index (CPI) is 1.02, the benefit-cost ratio is 1.7, and the latest round of performance reviews identified few required adjustments. The project team was colocated in a new building when the project started. Everyone commented on how excited they were to have all new facilities. The sponsor is providing adequate support for the project, and few unidentified risks have occurred. In an attempt to improve performance, the project manager spends part of the project budget on new chairs for the team members and adds the term 'senior' to each team members job title. Which of the following is the most correct thing that can be said of this project or the project manager?

A. The project manager has misunderstood Herzberg's theory.
B. The project is slowly spending more money than it should. The project manager should begin to watch cost more carefully.
C. The performance review should be handled better to find more adjustments.
D. The project manager should use good judgment to determine which variances are important.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Resource Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The option of the project manager watching cost more closely could trick you into selecting it if you are unsure of the real answer. There is no indication that the costs are trending in any particular direction.
There is no reason to think that performance reviews would turn up more adjustments. The project manager should always use good judgment but because nothing in this question talks about judgment regarding variances, this cannot be the best choice. In this situation, the project manager is making great working conditions better by buying new chairs and enhancing the team members' titles. According to Herzberg's theory, fixing bad working conditions will help motivate the team, but making good ones better will not improve motivation. The project manager needs to focus on the motivating agents and not the hygiene factors.

Q261During the first half of the project, five team members left for other projects without being replaced, two team members went on vacation without informing you, and other team members expressed uncertainty about the work they were to complete. In this situation, it is best if you update which of the following for the second half of the project?

A. Communications management plan
B. Resource histogram
C. Resource management plan
D. Responsibility assignment matrix
Correct Answer: C
Section: Resource Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The resource histogram shows the resources used per time period, but it would provide limited benefit in this situation. The responsibility assignment matrix cross-references resources with the activities or work packages they are to accomplish to help give clarity to the team members on their assignments, but it does not show when they will be required to do their work. The resource management plan, which describes when resources will be brought onto and taken off the project as well as how team members should communicate with the project manager, would provide the most benefit for this project.

Q263A large project is underway when one of the team members reviews the project status report. He sees the project is currently running late. As he looks at the report further, he notices the delay will cause one of his activities to be scheduled during a time he will be out of the country and will be unable to work on the activity. This is of great concern to the team member because he is committed to the success of the project and does not want to be the cause of the project being further delayed. What is the best thing for him to do?

A. Contact the project manager immediately to provide the project manager with his schedule.
B. Include the information in his next report.
C. Request that the issue be added to the project issue log.
D. Recommend preventive action.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Resource Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Notice that this question asks what the team member should do. It is important for the project manager to understand the team member's role and possibly even instruct team members on how to work on projects and what is expected of them. Providing the project manager with his schedule, including the information in a report, and requesting that the issue be added to the issue log have one thing in common. They involve the team member asking the project manager to do something. In reality, it may well be the team member who will come up with a solution (for example, decreasing the scope of the activity, fast tracking, or specific suggestions about changes to predecessor activities). Therefore, recommending preventive action is the best choice for the team member. Note that recommended corrective or preventive actions can come from the team or stakeholders in addition to the project manager.

Q264Many work packages have been successfully completed on the project, and the sponsor has made some recommendations for improvements. The project is on schedule to meet an aggressive deadline when the successor activity to a critical path activity suffers a major setback. The activity has 14 days of float and is being completed by four people. There are two other team members with the skill set to assist the troubled activity, if needed.
The project manager finds out that three other team members are attempting to be removed from the project because they do not feel the project can be successful. When the project manager investigates, she discovers that those team members have issues that have not been addressed. Which of the following is the best thing to do to improve the project?

A. Have the team members immediately assist the troubled activity.
B. Investigate why the project schedule is aggressive.
C. See who can replace the three team members.
D. Create an issue log.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Resource Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Sometimes complex problems are caused by not doing simple things. After you read the answer options, you should realize that the data in the first paragraph is completely extraneous. The troubled activity has float and so does not need immediate attention. It may not be necessary for additional team members to assist the troubled activity, but none of the choices suggest investigating whether the amount of float is enough to cover any delay caused by the trouble. Rather, the choices take you in different directions.
Investigating why the schedule is so aggressive should have been done before the project began.
Replacing team members does not solve the root cause of the problem. Could there be something the project manager is doing wrong, or could be doing that she is not, that would solve the problem without losing resources? Wouldn't it be more effective to discover the root cause of those team members' concerns so the problem does not surface again later? The creation of an issue log will let the troubled team members know their concerns have been heard, are noted, and will be resolved. This might be enough to stop them from leaving and avoid the resultant project delays and confusion if new team members must be added.

Q265In determining the physical resource requirements of the project, the team has identified the need for a highly specialized piece of testing equipment that will be used for approximately six months. The organization only owns one of these units, and it has been committed to other projects during the time this team will need it. Purchasing another similar unit is assumed to be cost-prohibitive. Which of the following is the least effective action for the project manager to take?

A. Negotiate with the project manager that has reserved the equipment during the time it is needed by this team.
B. Consult with the procurement department about the possibility of leasing a similar unit.
C. Request that the sponsor intervene on behalf of the project.
D. Adjust the schedule so that the work requiring the equipment can be done when the equipment is available.

Q267A team member has missed the last two team meetings. Several of his assigned deliverables were completed late, and not all were of acceptable quality. He requests a meeting with the project manager, where he explains that he has been dealing with a number of personal issues, which he realizes have affected his work. Although this has been concerning for the project manager, as he has had to smooth the irritation of other team members and even taken on some of the team member's responsibilities, the project manager shows concern to the team member.

A. Demonstrate courtesy and consideration of each other, and control who is allowed to speak.
B. Schedule meetings in advance.
C. Have a purpose for the meeting, with the right people in attendance.
D. Create and publish an agenda and a set of rules for controlling the meeting.
Correct Answer: D

Courtesy and consideration is not a 'rule' for effective meetings. Since there is no indication that the meeting was not scheduled in advance or that there isn't a purpose, these cannot be the best answers.
'Discussed at random' implies no agenda. If an agenda is issued beforehand, people will follow the outline and should not need random discussions.

Q281A team member is visiting the manufacturing plant of one of the suppliers. Which of the following is the most important thing to be done in any telephone calls the project manager might make to the team member?

A. Ask the team member to repeat back what the project manager says.
B. Review the list of contact information for all stakeholders.
C. Ask the team member to look for change requests.
D. Review the upcoming meeting schedule.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Communications Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
There are many choices that are reasonably correct. Look for the most immediate need. Here, the team member is in a manufacturing environment. That means communications will most likely be blocked by noise. It is best for the project manager to ask the team member to repeat back what he says, to ensure the team member correctly heard what the project manager communicated.

Q282A project manager overhears a conversation between two stakeholders who are discussing how unhappy they are with the impacts of the project on their own departments. Stakeholder A asks if the project is on time, and stakeholder B replies that the SPI is 1.05. Stakeholder A asks if the project manager for the project knows of stakeholder B's concern. Stakeholder B responds that he is not sure. What is the best thing for the project manager to do?

A. Make sure the stakeholders are aware that the project manager overheard. Then ask them to direct any questions to the project manager in writing.
B. Make a presentation to all the stakeholders regarding the status of the project.
C. Send both stakeholders a copy of the issue log, and ask for additional comments.
D. Arrange a meeting with both stakeholders to allow them to voice any concerns they may have.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Communications Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This is another question with more than one right answer. Would asking for something in writing be the best way to communicate? In this particular situation, asking for the concern to be put into writing might alienate the stakeholders. The issue log is where the issue should be listed, but the situation does not say if the project manager knows what the stakeholders' concern is. Therefore, using the issue log cannot be the best choice. Why not make a presentation to all the stakeholders regarding the status of the project? The concern was being voiced only by stakeholders A and B, so it is unnecessary to involve all the stakeholders.
This problem would likely require informal verbal communication to discover the real problem. Arranging a meeting with the concerned stakeholders is therefore the best choice.

Answer: 



Q283Things have been going well on the project. The work authorization system has allowed people to know when to start work, and the issue log has helped keep track of stakeholders' concerns. The sponsor has expressed his appreciation for the team members' efforts by hosting a milestone party. The project manager gets a call from a team member saying the results from the completion of her activity's predecessor are two days late. Which of the following reasons would best describe why this occurred?

A. The project manager was focusing on the sponsor's needs.
B. Functional management was not included in the communications management plan.
C. The successor activities should have been monitored, not the predecessors.
D. The right people were not invited to the milestone party.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Communications Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Since there is no information about the sponsor or his needs in this situation, focusing on his needs cannot be best. The statement that successor activities should have been watched, rather than the predecessors, is not a correct statement. A project manager should watch both predecessor and successor activities.
Attendance at the party and the issue at hand (the late results) are not related. Often forgotten in communications management plans are the bosses of team members (functional management, in a matrix organization). Including the bosses of team members in communications planning, requirements gathering, risk management, and other areas of project management helps make the project better. In addition, it helps the functional managers manage their resources effectively. If the functional manager of the team member assigned to the predecessor activity had been included in the project planning processes, he would have known when the team member was needed to do work for the project and the impact, if any, of delay. The communications management plan should also have included a method to communicate potential delays.

Q285The project has 13 team members and affects more than 15 departments in the organization. Because the project is 20 percent complete to date and the team has had successful performance reports from five of the affected departments, the project manager holds a party to celebrate. The project manager invites key stakeholders from all of the departments to the party in order to give those providing good reviews an informal opportunity to communicate good things to those departments that have not yet been affected by the project. At the party, the project manager walks around to try to discover any relevant information that would help her make the project even more successful. She happens to hear a manager of one of the departments talking about setting up more regular meetings on the project. The best thing for the project manager to do would be to first:

A. Record the effectiveness of the party in the project lessons learned.
B. Review the effectiveness of the project's communications management plan.
C. Hold a meeting of all the stakeholders to discuss their concerns.
D. Make sure the manager has a copy of the communications management plan so that he is reminded that such concerns should be sent to the project manager.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Communications Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Many of these choices could be done, but ask yourself, 'What is the most effective thing to do?' The party may well generate lessons learned, and recording them would certainly be a good idea, but the question asked what to do first. There is a more immediate issue"the manager. Meeting with all the stakeholders could be useful, but there is only one stakeholder, the manager, who definitely has an issue. Besides, a good project manager would be holding regular meetings with the stakeholders already. Making sure the manager has a copy of the communications management plan might be a good idea, as the manager apparently is not communicating with the project manager. However, this would not be enough to ensure the manager does communicate.
The manager is, in effect, saying he is not getting the information he needs, which is causing him to suggest more meetings. However, too many meetings can be a problem on projects. A great project manager does not just add meetings, but rather solves the real problem in the best way.
A goal of communications management is to get information to those who need it. The project manager may decide to adjust her communications management process by changing the format of a report or sending existing reports to the manager with the issue, rather than adding meetings. Therefore, the correct choice is to review the methods of providing project information to the stakeholders.

Answer: 



Q286The requirements of many stakeholders were not approved for inclusion in your project. Therefore, you had a difficult time gaining formal approval of the project management plan. The stakeholders argued and held up the project while they held meeting after meeting about their requirements. The project was finally approved and work began six months ago. All of the following would be good preventive actions to implement except:

A. Keep a file of what requirements were not included in the project.
B. Make sure the change control process is not used as a vehicle to add the requirements back into the project.
C. Maintain an issue log.
D. Hold meetings with the stakeholders to go over the work that will not be added to the project.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Communications Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This issue should be over, but since there were so many meetings and arguments about the requirements being removed, it is unlikely the issue will be dropped by the stakeholders. However, as it has not come up again and the project was started six months ago, spending time in a meeting is excessive. The other choices are easier, have less impact on the project, and are, therefore, things that could be done.

Q287The project manager is expecting a deliverable to be submitted by email from a team member today. At the end of the day, the project manager contacts the team member to notify him that it has not been received. The team member apologizes and explains that he was not able to email the deliverable, and it was sent through the mail instead. The team member goes on to remind the project manager that he had informed the project manager during a phone conversation that this would occur. 'Was that the conversation we had when I told you I could not hear you well due to poor cell phone coverage?' asks the project manager. 'Yes,' replies the team member. What could have been done to avoid this problem?

A. Verbal communication
B. Adding to the issue log after the phone call
C. Better attention to determining communications requirements
D. Feedback during the communication
Correct Answer: D
Section: Communications Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The pitch and tone of voice (verbal communication) is not relevant here, as the project manager could not even hear all that was being said. There were no issues recognized after the conversation, so none could be added to the issue log. This issue is not related to communications requirements, so that choice cannot be best. Saying, 'I am not sure I properly heard what you said,' during the conversation or repeating the message back to the team member would have prevented this problem. Giving and requesting feedback during the communication is the best option.

Q292If a project has a 60 percent chance of a $100,000 profit and a 40 percent chance of a $100,000 loss, the expected monetary value (EMV) for the project is:

A. $100,000 profit
B. $60,000 loss
C. $20,000 profit
D. $40,000 loss
Correct Answer: C
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Expected monetary value is calculated by EMV = probability x impact. We need to calculate both positive and negative values and then add them:
0.6 x$ 100,000 = $60,000 0.4 x ($100,000) = ($40,000)
Expected monetary value = $60,000 - $40,000 = $20,000 profit

Q293Assuming the ends of a range of estimates are +/- 3 sigma from the mean, which of the following range estimates involves the least risk?

A. 30 days, plus or minus 5 days
B. 22 to 30 days
C. Optimistic = 26 days, most likely = 30 days, pessimistic = 33 days
D. Mean of 28 days
Correct Answer: C
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A mean of 28 days is not a range estimate, and so must be eliminated as a possible answer. When you look at the ranges of each of the other choices, you will see that 30 days, plus or minus 5 days = a range of 10 days. The range of 22 to 30 days = a range of 8 days. An optimistic estimate of 26 days, most likely estimate of 30 days, and pessimistic estimate of 33 days represents a range of 7 days. The estimate with the smallest range is the least risky, and is therefore the correct choice. Did you realize the words '+/- 3 sigma' are extraneous? Practice reading questions that are wordy and have extraneous data.

Q294Which of the following risk events is most likely to interfere with attaining a project's schedule objective?

A. Delays in obtaining required approvals
B. Substantial increases in the cost of purchased materials
C. Contract disputes that generate claims for increased payments
D. Slippage of the planned post-implementation review meeting
Correct Answer: A
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Cost increases and contract disputes for payments will not necessarily interfere with schedule. If a post- implementation review meeting slips, it may not interfere with the project schedule. Delays in obtaining required approvals always cause time delays, and are therefore the most likely to threaten the project schedule.

Q301A new project manager is beginning work on her first project. She is planning to use her training to implement many risk identification methods. She realizes that some identified risks will be managed throughout the project, while others will not be considered important enough to deal with. She is aware that risk management is ongoing throughout the project, as new risks may be identified, risk ratings may change, and the project itself may change. She realizes that all the following are common results of risk management except:

A. Contract terms and conditions are created.
B. The project management plan is changed.
C. The communications management plan is changed.
D. The project charter is changed.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A contract is a tool to transfer risk. The project management plan could change to include a modified WBS and new work packages related to mitigating risk. The communications management plan could change as a way to address a risk. A change to the charter is a fundamental change to the project and may require a major adjustment to all aspects of the project management plan. It is not a common result of risk management efforts.

Reference:
A risk is only escalated if it is outside the scope of the project or beyond the project manager's authority, which is not the case in this scenario. Acceptance of risk means doing nothing (if it happens, it happens, or contingency plans are created). Avoidance of risk means we change the way we will execute the project so the risk is no longer a factor. Transference is passing the risk off to another party. Many people think of using insurance as a way of decreasing impact. However, purchasing insurance transfers the risk to another party.

A. Identify Risks
B. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
C. Plan Risk Responses
D. Monitor Risks
Correct Answer: D
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Creating a workaround involves determining how to handle a risk that has occurred but that was not included in the risk register. The project must be in the Monitor Risks process if risks have occurred.

Q307A project manager has just finished the risk response plan for a $387,000 engineering project. Which of the following should he probably do next?

A. Determine the overall risk rating of the project.
B. Begin to analyze the risks that show up in the project drawings.
C. Add work packages to the project work breakdown structure.
D. Hold a project risk review.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This situation is occurring during project planning. Planning must be completed before moving on.
Determining the risk rating of the project is done during Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, and should have already been done. Project risk reviews occur during Monitor Risks. Adding work packages that are part of the newly planned risk responses comes next in project planning. This is an example of iterating the project management plan.

Answer: 



Q308A project manager analyzed the quality of risk data and asked various stakeholders to determine the probability and impact of a number of risks. He is about to move to the next process of risk management. Based on this information, what has the project manager forgotten to do?

A. Evaluate trends in risk analysis.
B. Identify triggers.
C. Provide a standardized risk rating matrix.
D. Create a fallback plan.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project manager is in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. This process includes risk data quality assessment along with probability and impact matrix development. It appears the project manager has not yet completed the matrix, which is used to sort risks based on their probability and impact ratings.
Trend analysis, the identification of triggers, and the development of fallback plans will occur later in risk management.

Answer: 



Q309A project manager has assembled the project team. They have identified 56 risks on the project, determined what would trigger the risks, rated them on a risk rating matrix, tested their assumptions, and assessed the quality of the data used. The team is continuing to move through the risk management process. What has the project manager forgotten to do?

A. Conduct a simulation.
B. Perform risk mitigation.
C. Determine the overall risk ranking for the project.
D. Involve other stakeholders.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

Q310You are a project manager for the construction of a major new manufacturing plant that is unlike any that has been done before. The project cost is estimated at $30,000,000, and the project will make use of three sellers. Once begun, the project cannot be cancelled, as there will be a large expenditure on plant and equipment. When managing a project, it is most important to carefully:

A. Review all cost proposals from the sellers.
B. Examine the budget reserves.
C. Complete the project charter.
D. Perform an identification of risks.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A review of cost proposals could be done, but it is not a pressing issue based on the situation provided.
Examining the budget reserves could also be done, but not until risk response planning is completed. It is always important to carefully complete a project charter, but there are other issues needing detailed attention in this situation. Since a project like this has never been done before, and there will be a large cost outlay, it would be best for the project manager to spend more time on risk management. Risk identification is the most proactive response and will have the greatest positive impact on the project.

Q311Your team has come up with 434 risks and 16 major causes of those risks. The project is the last in a series of projects that the team has worked on together. The sponsor is very supportive, and a lot of time was invested in making sure the project work was complete and signed off by all key stakeholders. During project planning, the team cannot come up with an effective way to mitigate or insure against a risk. It is not work that can be outsourced, nor can it be deleted. What would be the best solution?

A. Accept the risk.
B. Continue to investigate ways to mitigate the risk.
C. Look for ways to avoid the risk.
D. Look for ways to transfer the risk.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This question relates real-world situations to risk types. Did you realize the entire first paragraph is extraneous? Based on the question, you cannot remove the work to avoid it, nor can you insure or outsource it to transfer the risk. This leaves acceptance as the only correct choice.

Q313Having just been hired to manage a project to improve the efficiency of data processing in the accounting department, the project manager is most concerned about managing risk on the project. The timeline is short, and the sponsor's expectations are high. Which of the following would best help the project manager in her initial assessment of risks on the project?

A. A sensitivity analysis
B. Her project scope statement from the project planning process
C. A review of enterprise environmental factors
D. A conversation with a project manager who worked on a similar project Correct Answer: D
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Sensitivity analysis is a tool of quantitative risk analysis, and is used to compare risks to the project that have already been identified. Reviewing the scope statement is a good idea, but it will only provide an assessment of risk on that aspect of the project. Enterprise environmental factors involve company culture and organization, which also are not adequate to assess overall project risk. A conversation with a project manager who worked on a similar project would provide the most value, as the risks she dealt with on that project are likely to be similar to what the project manager will experience on this project.

Q314You have been appointed as the manager of a new, large, and complex project. Because this project is business-critical and highly visible, senior management has told you to analyze the project's risks and prepare response strategies for them as soon as possible. The organization has risk management procedures that are seldom used or followed, and has had a history of handling risks badly. The project's first milestone is in two weeks. In preparing the risk response plan, input from which of the following is generally least important?

A. Project team members
B. Project sponsor
C. Individuals responsible for risk management policies and templates
D. Key stakeholders
Correct Answer: B
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Team members will have knowledge of the project as well as the product of the project and will thus have a lot to contribute to risk responses. Those responsible for risk templates will be able to provide the templates from past projects (historical records) and will, therefore, be very important. Key stakeholders will know more about the technical work of the project and can help plan 'What are we going to do about it?' Because of that, they are not likely to be the least important. The sponsor may have the least knowledge of what will work to address risks. Sponsors need to be involved in the project and help identify risks. They may even approve the response plans created by others, but they are not generally major contributors to response plans.

Q315You were in the middle of a two-year project to deploy new technology to field offices across the country. A hurricane caused power outages just when the upgrade was near completion. When the power was restored, all the project reports and historical data were lost, with no way of retrieving them. What should have been done to prevent this problem?

A. Purchase insurance.
B. Plan for a reserve fund.
C. Monitor the weather and have a contingency plan.
D. Schedule the installation outside of the hurricane season.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The risk is the loss of data due to a power outage. Purchasing insurance is not related to preventing the problem. It transfers the risk. Creating a reserve fund is acceptance of the risk, and would help address the cost factors after the power failure, but it would not reduce the probability or impact of the power failure.
Avoiding the hurricane by scheduling the installation at a different time reduces the power outage risk, but could have a large negative impact on the project schedule and so is not the best choice. The best choice of the options provided is to monitor the weather and know when to implement the contingency plan.

Q316A system development project is nearing project closing when a previously unidentified risk is discovered. This could potentially affect the projects overall ability to deliver. What should be done next?

A. Alert the project sponsor of potential impacts to cost, scope, or schedule.
B. Qualify the risk.
C. Mitigate this risk by developing a risk response plan.
D. Develop a workaround.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A workaround is an unplanned response to an event that is occurring. The risk discussed in the question has been identified, but it is not occurring at this time, so there is no need to take the action of creating a workaround. You need to analyze the problem before talking to the sponsor. You cannot mitigate the risk until you qualify it. Qualifying the risk will help you determine how to proceed.

Q317The cost performance index (CPI) of a project is 0.6, and the schedule performance index (SPI) is 0.71. The project has 625 work packages and is being completed over a four-year period. The team members are inexperienced, and the project received little support for proper planning. Which of the following is the best thing to do?

A. Update risk identification and analysis.
B. Spend more time improving the cost estimates.
C. Remove as many work packages as possible.
D. Reorganize the responsibility assignment matrix.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Risk Management
Explanation

This project has deviated so far from the baseline that updated risk identification and risk analysis should be performed.

Answer: 



Q318You believe that the project you have undertaken is relatively straightforward, with less risk than most other projects you have worked on. Therefore, you do not spend a long time on risk identification. While preparing your risk responses, you identify secondary risks that could result in serious consequences later in the project. What should you do?

A. Add reserves to the project to accommodate the new risks and notify management.
B. Document the risk items, and calculate the expected monetary value based on the probability and impact of the occurrences.
C. Determine the risk events and the associated costs, then add the cost to the project budget as a reserve.
D. Add a 10 percent contingency to the project budget, and notify the customer.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
When new risks are identified, they should go through the risk management process. You need to subjectively determine the probability and impact of the risks, and if the risks are determined to pose significant threats to the project, attempt to diminish the threats through the Plan Risk Responses process.
Only after these efforts should you consider adding reserves for time and/or cost. Any reserves should be based on a detailed analysis of risk. Calculating the expected monetary value of the risks is an important part of the risk management process, and the best choice presented here.

Q319During project executing, a team member is coordinating with a supplier, and identifies a risk that is not in the risk register. It appears that the pieces of heavy equipment you have ordered from a supplier are larger than anticipated, and they may not all fit into the warehouse the team has leased to store them until they are needed. What should you do?

A. Get further information on how the team member identified the risk because you already performed a detailed analysis and did not identify this risk.
B. Disregard the risk because risks were identified during project planning.
C. Inform the customer about the risk.
D. Analyze the risk.
Correct Answer: D

Q320During project executing, the team member who is most experienced in the programming work required for the project informs you that he has accepted a new position at another company, and has given his two weeks' notice. This is a major problem that was not included in the risk register. What should you do first?

A. Create a workaround.
B. Reevaluate the Identify Risks process.
C. Look for any unexpected effects of the problem.
D. Tell management.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Because an unidentified problem or risk occurred, it is important to reevaluate the Identify Risks process as well as to look for unexpected effects of the problem. However, they are not your first choices. You might need to inform management, but this is reactive, not proactive, and also not the first thing you should do.
Since this is a problem that has occurred, rather than a problem that has just been identified, the first thing you must do is address the risk by creating a workaround.

Q321Which of the following is the primary responsibility of a risk owner?

A. Identify new risks and create workarounds.
B. Respond to risk triggers and implement the planned risk responses.
C. Report to the project manager that a risk has occurred, and note the consequences.
D. Quantitatively analyze risks as assigned by the project manager.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A risk owner may be involved in developing risk responses for their assigned risk. They are also responsible for monitoring the project for triggers that indicate the risk is imminent and for managing implementation of the planned risk response.

Answer: 



Q322A project has had some problems, but now seems under control. In the last few months, almost all the reserve has been used, and most of the negative impacts of events that had been predicted have occurred. There are only four activities left, and two of them are on the critical path. Management now informs the project manager that it would be in the performing organizations best interest to finish the project two weeks earlier than scheduled in order to receive an additional profit. In response, the project manager sends out a request for proposal for some work that the team was going to do, hoping to find another company that might be able to do the work faster. The project manager can best be said to be attempting to work with:

A. Reserves
B. Opportunities
C. Scope validation
D. Threats
Correct Answer: B
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The wording of this question can be confusing. Scope validation involves meeting with the customer to gain formal acceptance, so that cannot be the best choice. Reserve is mentioned in the situation, but the use of reserves is not the primary concern. The project manager is working to make a positive impact on the project more likely to occur. Therefore, he is working with an opportunity. This may include analyzing the appropriateness of using management reserves to cover the cost of exploiting the opportunity.

Answer: 



Q323Monte Carlo analysis is used to:

A. Get an indication of the risk involved in the project.
B. Estimate an activity's length.
C. Simulate possible quality issues on the project.
D. Prove to management that extra staff is needed.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A Monte Carlo analysis could indicate that an estimate for an activity needs to change, but it does not indicate what the activity estimate should be. Monte Carlo is a simulation, but it does not specifically address quality. It does not deal directly with staff or resource needs either. Project risk can be assessed using Monte Carlo analysis. By considering the inputs to the weighted estimates along with the network diagram, you can get a better idea of the overall project risk.

Q324A project team is creating a project management plan when management asks them to identify project risks and provide some form of qualitative output as soon as possible. What should the project team provide?

A. Risk triggers
B. Prioritized list of risks
C. Contingency reserves
D. Probability of achieving the time and cost objectives
Correct Answer: B
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This question essentially asks, 'What is an output of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis?' The probability of achieving time and cost objectives is determined during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.
Risk triggers and contingency reserves are parts of the Plan Risk Responses process. A prioritized list of risks is an output of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis.

Answer: 



Q325A project manager is creating a risk response plan. However, every time a risk response is suggested, another risk is identified that is caused by the response. Which of the following is the best thing for the project manager to do?

A. Get more people involved in the Identify Risks process, since risks have been missed.
B. Make sure the project work is better understood.
C. Spend more time making sure the risk responses are clearly defined.
D. Document the new risks and continue the Plan Risk Responses process.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Did you realize this question describes secondary risks? Identifying secondary risks is an important part of completing the Plan Risk Responses process. With that in mind, the best thing to do is to document the newly identified risks and continue the Plan Risk Responses process.

Q326A watch list is an output of which risk management process?

A. Plan Risk Responses
B. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
C. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
D. Implement Risk Responses
Correct Answer: C
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A watch list is made up of low-priority risks that, in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process, were determined to be of too low priority or low impact to require further attention at this time.

Answer: 



Q327During the Identify Risks process, a project manager and stakeholders used various methods to identify risks and created a long list of those risks. The project manager then made sure all the risks were understood and that triggers had been identified. Later, in the Plan Risk Responses process, he took all the risks identified by the stakeholders and determined ways to mitigate them. What has he done wrong?

A. The project manager should have waited until the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process to get the stakeholders involved.
B. More people should have been involved in the Plan Risk Responses process.
C. The project manager should have created workarounds.
D. Triggers should not be identified until the Implement Risk Responses process.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Risk Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Stakeholders should be included in the Identify Risks process. Some triggers may be identified in the Identify Risks process, but they are generally identified and added to the risk register in the Plan Risk Responses process. Workarounds are created as unidentified risk events occur. The project managers error was not including others in the Plan Risk Responses process. Plan Risk Responses must include the involvement of all risk owners and possibly other stakeholders as well.

Q329Once signed, a contract is legally binding unless:

A. One party is unable to perform.
B. One party is unable to finance its part of the work.
C. It is in violation of applicable law.
D. It is declared null and void by either party's legal counsel.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Once signed, a contract is binding to both sides. Contracts typically state that either side can choose to terminate the agreement by negotiating a settlement based on work already performed. Generally, the inability to perform or get financing, or one party's belief that the contract is null and void does not change the fact that the contract is binding. If, however, both sides agree to terminate the contract, the contract can move into closure. An illegal contract is not enforceable.

Q330With a clear procurement statement of work, a seller completes work as specified, but the buyer is not pleased with the results. The contract is considered to be:

A. Null and void
B. Incomplete
C. Complete
D. Waived
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
If the seller completes the work specified in the procurement statement of work, the contract is considered complete. That does not mean the same thing as the procurement being closed. Procurement closure must still occur. However, in this situation, the contract work is completed.

Q331You are preparing procurement documents for the building of a community center. There will be government standards, guidelines, and possibly regulations involved. You need to structure the procurement documentation in order to get proposals from qualified prospective sellers interested in doing business on a particular project. All the following statements concerning procurement documents are incorrect except:

A. Well-designed procurement documents can simplify comparison of responses.
B. Procurement documents must be rigorous with little flexibility to allow consideration of seller suggestions.
C. In general, procurement documents should not include selection criteria.
D. Well-designed procurement documents do not include a procurement statement of work.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Often, the seller is required to inform the buyer of anything that is missing or unclear in the procurement documents. It is in the buyer's best interest to discover missing items, since it will save the buyer money and trouble to correct the problem early. Procurement documents must include terms and conditions and selection criteria, as well as documentation of all the work that is to be done (which includes the procurement statement of work). This is so the seller can price the project and know what is most important to the buyer. Well-designed procurement documents can simplify comparison of responses. This is an important point and is the best answer.

Q332A project manager for the seller is told by her management that the project team should do whatever possible to be awarded incentive money. The primary objective of incentive clauses in a contract is to:

A. Reduce costs for the buyer.
B. Help the seller control costs.
C. Synchronize objectives.
D. Reduce risk for the seller by shifting risk to the buyer.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Incentives are meant to bring the objectives of the seller in line with those of the buyer, so both are working toward the same objective.

Q333All the following statements about change control are incorrect except:

A. A fixed-price contract will minimize the need for change control.
B. Changes seldom provide real benefits to the project.
C. Contracts should include procedures to accommodate changes.
D. More detailed specifications eliminate the causes of changes.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
There are always good ideas (changes) that can add benefit to the project, regardless of the contract type.
Although detailed specifications may reduce the need for changes, they do not eliminate all the causes.
Contracts should include procedures to accommodate changes.

Answer: 



Q334A routine audit of a cost-reimbursable (CR) contract determines that overcharges are being made. If the contract does not specify corrective action, the buyer should:

A. Continue to make project payments.
B. Halt payments until the problem is corrected.
C. Void the contract and start legal action to recover overpayments.
D. Change the contract to require more frequent audits.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Halting all payments would be a breach of contract on the buyer's part. Voiding the contract and beginning legal action is too severe and cannot be done unilaterally. Changing the contract to require more frequent audits does not solve the problem presented. A choice that said, 'Halt payments on the disputed amount' would probably be the best answer, but it is not offered. The best choice available is to continue to make the payments while working to resolve the issue.

Answer: 



Q335Buyers and sellers have many common goals, but some goals of the buyer will not benefit the seller. Likewise, the seller will sometimes have goals that conflict with those of the buyer. These could negatively affect the project if contracts are not negotiated appropriately. The primary objective of contract negotiations is to:

A. Get the most from the other side.
B. Protect the relationship.
C. Get the highest monetary return.
D. Define objectives and stick to them
Correct Answer: B
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
As a project manager, you want to develop a good relationship during negotiations that will last throughout the project. Negotiations are not about getting the most from the other side (win-lose), as such actions will not create a good relationship. That doesn't mean, however, the buyer sacrifices what is best for the organization.

Answer: 



Q336A seller is working on a cost-reimbursable (CR) contract when the buyer decides he would like to expand the scope of services and change to a fixed-price (FP) contract. All the following are the seller's options except:

A. Completing the original work on a cost-reimbursable basis and then negotiating a fixed price for the additional work
B. Completing the original work and rejecting the additional work
C. Negotiating a fixed-price contract that includes all the work
D. Starting over with a new contract
Correct Answer: D
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The seller can try to negotiate changes or simply continue the original contract and refuse requests to complete additional work, but the seller cannot unilaterally decide to start over with a new contract. Both parties have to agree to this option through negotiations.

Q337You have narrowed down the prospective sellers, and conducted a bidder conference. You are prepared to enter into a contract with the desired seller, and are checking that everything is in order for final contract negotiations and contract finalization. You have only a couple of points to clarify with the seller. All the following must be present to have a contract except:

A. A procurement statement of work
B. Acceptance
C. The address of the seller
D. Buyers' signatures
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Many people miss the fact that a contract includes a procurement statement of work. To have a contract, you must also have acceptance. One set of signatures is not enough; you must have sign-off (acceptance) from both parties, not just from the buyer. The address of the seller is not required, and therefore is the exception.

Q339You are working to plan procurements for a project that will develop a prototype cruise ship. The prototype will be tested, perfected, and then used to create a small fleet. In addition to creating a procurement management plan, you must put together bid documents describing the project needs and the criteria that will be used to select a seller. Which of the following will occur during this projects Plan Procurement Management process?

A. Make-or-buy decisions
B. Answering sellers' questions about the bid documents
C. Advertising
D. Proposal evaluation
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management

Q340Which of the foliowing is the best thing for a project manager to do in the Conduct Procurements process?

A. Evaluate risks.
B. Select a contract type.
C. Perform market research.
D. Answer sellers' questions about the procurement documents.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Risk analysis is done before the Conduct Procurements process begins, as procurement is a risk mitigation and transference tool. Selecting a contract type is part of Plan Procurement Management. Market research is also performed in the Plan Procurement Management process, to enable selection of the appropriate sellers for the needs of the project. During the Conduct Procurements process, the project manager answers questions submitted by prospective sellers.

Q341The sponsor is worried about the seller deriving extra profit on the cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract. Each month he requires the project manager to submit CPI calculations and an analysis of the cost to complete. The project manager explains to the sponsor that extra profits should not be a worry on this project because:

A. The team is making sure the seller does not cut scope.
B. All costs invoiced are being audited.
C. There can only be a maximum 10 percent increase if there is an unexpected cost overrun.
D. The fee is only received by the seller when the project is completed.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Cutting scope decreases profits on this type of contract, so that would not be a way for the seller to generate extra profits. CPFF contracts generally do not limit fee increases. The fee in a CPFF contract is usually paid out on a continuous basis during the life of the project. One of the ways to change the profit in a cost plus fixed fee contract is to invoice for items not chargeable to the project. This would not be ethical by the seller but does not mean that a seller may not try it. Therefore, all invoiced costs should be audited.

Answer: 



Q342You are considering using a fixed-price (FP) contract, because you have well-defined requirements for your construction project. With your requirements and your understanding of the seller's competition, you are confident you will be able to establish a complete statement of work. The fee or profit in this type of contract
is:

A. Unknown
B. Part of the negotiation involved in paying every invoice
C. Applied as a line item to every invoice
D. Determined with the other party at the end of the project
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The fee or profit is known to the seller, but this question is asked from the buyers perspective. The buyer does not know what profit the seller included in the response to the bid document and, therefore, will not know the profit in the fixed-price contract.

Answer: 



Q343As part of closing a cost-reimbursable contract on a project, what must the buyer remember to do?

A. Decrease the risk rating of the project.
B. Audit seller's cost submittals.
C. Evaluate the fee she is paying.
D. Make sure the seller is not adding resources.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Although a reserve might be decreased for the overall project when one of its procurements enters closure, the risk rating of the project is generally not affected. Evaluation of the fee should have been done during the Conduct Procurements process. Making sure the seller does not add resources should not be necessary, as the contracted work has been completed. Auditing the seller's cost submittals is a required aspect of the Control Procurements process.

Answer: 



Q344The sponsor and the project manager are discussing what type of contract the project manager plans to use on the project. The sponsor points out that the performing organization paid a design team a lot of money to come up with the design. The project manager is concerned that the risk for the buyer be as small as possible, and recommends a fixed-price contract. An advantage of a fixed-price contract for the buyer is:

A. Cost risk is lower.
B. Cost risk is higher.
C. There is little risk.
D. Risk is shared by all parties.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
If you had trouble with this one, you need to remember that the questions are asked from the buyer's perspective unless otherwise noted. The seller has the most cost risk in a fixed-price contract, and the buyer's risk is lower because the buyer will not pay more if the seller does not control costs. The seller has the risk; if they do not control the costs, they could erode the profit margin and even lose money.

B. Procurement statement of work
C. Terms and conditions
D. Negotiation process
Correct Answer: D
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

Q346A project has a tight budget when you begin negotiating with a seller for a piece of equipment. The seller has told you the equipment price is fixed. Your manager has told you to negotiate the cost with the seller. Your assessment is that the piece of equipment has been offered at inflated pricing. What is your best course of action?

A. Make a good faith effort to find a way to decrease the cost.
B. Postpone negotiations until you can convince your manager to change his mind.
C. Hold the negotiations, but only negotiate other aspects of the project.
D. Cancel the negotiations.

Q347Which of the following is an advantage of centralized contracting?

A. Increased expertise
B. Easier access
C. The project manager doesn't have to be involved
D. More loyalty to the project
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Centralized contracting refers to a situation in which a procurement department exists to oversee procurements across the entire organization. Because there may be many procurements going on simultaneously, it may be difficult to get access to the procurement manager. As their attention is divided between multiple contracts, the procurement manager has less loyalty to any one project. Even with the procurement department leading a procurement, the project manager must participate in the process, so that is not an advantage. Increased expertise of the procurement manager is an advantage of centralized contracting.

Answer: 



Q348With which type of contract is the seller most concerned about project scope?

A. Fixed-price
B. Cost plus fixed fee
C. Time and material
D. Purchase order
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
In a fixed-price contract, the seller has the cost risk and therefore wants to completely understand the procurement statement of work before bidding.

Answer: 



Q349Your company has an emergency and needs contracted work done as soon as possible. Under these circumstances, which of the following would be the most helpful to add to the contract?

A. A clear procurement statement of work
B. Requirements as to which subcontractors can be used
C. Incentives
D. A force majeure clause
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
If you follow the proper project management process, you always have good definition of scope (in this case, the procurement statement of work). In this situation, both good scope definition and incentives are required. Along with good scope definition, you need the seller to share your need for speed. Incentives bring the seller's objectives in line with the buyer's and thus would be the most helpful. Good scope definition alone does not ensure speed.

Answer: 



Q350You are the project manager of a relatively small project to build out improvements to a small shop in a pedestrian mall. The project is using a time and material contract, and you know you must be involved in negotiations. Which of the following is an advantage of a time and material contract?

A. A time and material contract is less work for the buyer to manage.
B. The seller has a strong incentive to control costs.
C. The total price is known.
D. Negotiations are less extensive.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Negotiation of a time and material contract is generally less extensive than negotiation of other contract types. The other choices are advantages of a fixed-price contract.

However, when the work is being done, Party B claims they are not required to provide an item they both agreed to during negotiations, because it was not included in the subsequent contract. In this case, Party B is:

A. Incorrect, because both parties must comply with what they agreed on
B. Correct, because there was an offer
C. Generally correct, because both parties are only required to perform what is in the contract
D. Generally incorrect, because all agreements must be upheld

Q356The project manager, the procurement manager, and the project sponsor are discussing the project costs and whether it is better to have their own company do some of the project work or hire another company to do all the work. Generally, it would be better for the organization to do the work internally if:

A. There is a lot of proprietary data.
B. You have the expertise, but you do not have the available manpower.
C. You do not need control over the work.
D. Your company resources are limited.
Correct Answer: A

Q357After much hard work, the procurement statement of work for the project is completed. However, even after gaining agreement that the procurement statement of work is complete, the project manager is unsure of whether it actually addresses all the buyer's needs. The project manager is about to attend the bidder conference. He asks you for advice on what to do during the session. Which of the following is the best advice you can give him?

A. You do not need to attend this session; the procurement manager will hold it.
B. Make sure you negotiate project scope.
C. Make sure you give all the sellers the opportunity to ask questions.
D. Let the project sponsor handle the meeting so you can be the good guy in the negotiation session.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project manager should attend the bidder conference, although the procurement manager may lead it.
Did you select negotiating scope? Sellers may ask questions about scope during the conference, but negotiations occur after the bidder conference, when the buyer selects one or more sellers with whom to negotiate. Allowing ample opportunity for all the prospective sellers to ask questions is one of the many challenges of a bidder conference. They may not want to ask questions while their competitors are present.

Q358A seller is awarded a contract to build a pipeline. The contract terms and conditions require a work plan to be issued for the buyer's approval prior to commencing work, but the seller fails to provide one. Which of the following is the best thing for the buyers project manager to do?

A. File a letter of intent.
B. Develop the work plan and issue it to the seller to move things along.
C. Issue a default letter.
D. Issue a stop work order to the seller until a work plan is prepared.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
When a seller does not perform according to the contract terms and conditions, they have defaulted and the project manager must take action. You might prefer a choice to investigate the default by contacting the seller and asking what is going on, but that choice is not available here. You must send the formal written notice as soon as you become aware of the default so that you do not give up any right to receive the work plan in the future. You can contact the seller for a discussion as the second thing you do. Therefore, the best choice is to let the seller know they are in default. The default notification letter will instruct the seller to meet the performance requirement.

Q359Procurement closure is different from the Close Project or Phase process in that procurement closure:

A. Occurs before Close Project or Phase
B. Is the only one to involve the customer
C. Includes the return of property
D. May be done more than once for each contract
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The customer may be involved in lessons learned and procurement audits, and would certainly be involved in formal acceptance. Both procurement closure and the Close Project or Phase process involve the return of property. Procurement closure is done once for each procurement, at the end of the contract. All procurements are closed before the project is closed.

Q362The $800,000 contract specifies that the seller will bill the buyer at $10,000 per month. However, the seller is able to complete the project work faster than planned. Therefore, they bill the buyer for $15,000 for the work performed in the past month. The buyer should:

A. Send a breach of contract notice.
B. Pay the invoice, as they will save on future payments.
C. Meet with the seller to discuss the overcharge.
D. Adjust the contract to allow for variations in monthly billings.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
By paying the additional amount of this months invoice, the buyer may waive the right to limit monthly costs to $10,000. The project has allocated $10,000 per month for this seller, and the buyer may not have the capacity to pay more each month. By agreeing to the terms of the contract, the seller is contractually obligated not to exceed that amount. A breach of contract notice from the buyer to the seller is the best way to handle this situation.

Q363You are the project manager at a software development company, leading a project to develop an innovative application for a client. The project has followed a strict software engineering process. The requirements have been specified in detail, resulting in extensive functional and technical specification documents. Your project team member delivers an interim project deliverable to the buyer. However, the buyer refuses the deliverable, stating it does not meet the requirement on page 300 of the technical specifications. You review the document and find that you agree. What is the best thing to do?

A. Explain that the contract is wrong and should be changed.
B. Issue a change order.
C. Review the requirements, and meet with the responsible team member to review the WBS dictionary.
D. Call a meeting of the team to review the requirement on page 300.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This question is written from the perspective of the seller. The contract could be wrong or the customer could be wrong, but this should have been discovered earlier if proper project management was followed. A seller cannot issue a change order (although they could request one). Did you select calling a meeting of the team? If so, remember that proper project management does not mean making every decision with all the team members. The best choice involves reviewing the requirements documentation and meeting with the appropriate team member. If such a problem has arisen, it could mean something was wrong in the WBS dictionary or in how the team member completed the work.

Q364Your organization has recently been informed that several of the regulations related to how your products are manufactured will change in six months. In planning for work to change certain design and production processes, you determine you will need to work with several external organizations to do the work. Which type of contract do you not want to use if you do not have enough help to audit invoices?

A. Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)
B. Time & material (T&M)
C. Fixed-price (FP)
D. Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF)
Correct Answer: A
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
If you got this question wrong, reread it. You need to audit invoices in all contract types, so how do you choose? Look for the answer that is best. In this case, it would be the choice that requires the greatest effort. A T&M contract should be used for low dollar and short duration contracts (remember that a T&M contract has no incentive to finish), so it does not have a high level of risk. FP and FPIF contracts cannot be best, because the risk to the buyer is limited. The buyer is still only going to pay the contracted price. In a CPFF contract, the buyer pays all costs. The seller could be charging the buyer for costs that should not be allocated to the buyer. Because of the size and dollar amount of this type of contract, and because the risk to the buyer is great, a CPFF contract requires the most auditing. In this case, you would not want to use a CPFF contract.

Q365A new project manager is about to begin creating the procurement statement of work. One stakeholder wants to add many items to the procurement statement of work. Another stakeholder only wants to describe the functional requirements. The project is important for the project manager's company, but a seller will do the work. How would you advise the project manager?

A. The procurement statement of work should be general, to allow the seller to make their own decisions.
B. The procurement statement of work should be general, to allow for clarification later.
C. The procurement statement of work should be detailed, to allow for clarification later.
D. The procurement statement of work should be as detailed as necessary for the type of project.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Procurement Management
Explanation

Q366The product of your project is a human resource application that will help the company with hiring and onboarding new employees. The team will be working on requirements affecting the needs of some of the stakeholders throughout the project. The requirements of other stakeholders will only come into play during a small part of toward the end of the project. When do stakeholders have the most influence on a project?

A. At the beginning of the project
B. In the middle of the project
C. At the end of the project
D. Throughout the project
Correct Answer: A
Section: Stakeholder Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Stakeholders have an impact throughout the project, but they must be identified and involved at the beginning of the project in order to determine their requirements and expectations. This means that even stakeholders who play a smaller role or whose requirements are addressed later in the project are included early. If this effort is not done early, the results may be expensive changes and/or dissatisfaction later in the project.

Q367The project has been going well, except for the number of changes being made. The product of the project is being installed into seven different departments within the company and will greatly improve departmental performance when operational. The team has selected the appropriate processes for use on the project. The project manager is a technical expert and has been trained in communications and managing people. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the project changes?

A. The project manager was not trained in understanding the company environment.
B. The project should have more management oversight since it will result in such great benefits to the company.
C. The project should have used more of the project management processes.
D. Some stakeholders were not identified.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Stakeholder Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
It is important to look for the choice that would solve the real problem. The most likely root cause is that stakeholders were missed and, as a result, their requirements were not identified. Those stakeholders are now requesting changes to accommodate their needs. There is no reason to think that training, management oversight, or a need for more processes are factors contributing to the number of changes.

Answer: 



Q368You have been tentatively assigned to a project that has not yet received final approval. Several stakeholders who will likely be involved or impacted by the project have already been identified. Stakeholders can be identified during which project management process groups?

A. Initiating, planning, executing, and monitoring and controlling
B. Initiating and planning
C. Planning and monitoring and controlling
D. Monitoring and controlling and closing
Correct Answer: A
Section: Stakeholder Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Stakeholders can be identified throughout the project. However, the earlier stakeholders are identified, the better for the project. If all the stakeholders' needs and requirements are taken into account before plans are finalized and project work is begun, fewer changes will be needed later in the project, when they will be more costly.

Answer: 



Q369A particular stakeholder has a reputation for requesting many changes on projects. You'll be working with this stakeholder, as you've just been assigned as project manager of a project with which he'll also be involved. The newly approved project will create a website that has a couple of features the stakeholder's clients will use. However, the clients in this business unit will use the site only occasionally. What is the best approach you can take at the beginning of the project to manage this situation?

A. Say no to the stakeholder a few times to dissuade him from submitting more changes.
B. Get the stakeholder involved in the project as early as possible.
C. Talk to the stakeholder's manager to find ways of directing the stakeholder's activities to another project.
D. Ask that the stakeholder be changed to one who will better represent those using the core functionality of the new website.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Stakeholder Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
By definition, stakeholders can impact or be impacted by the project. The project manager may not choose who to recognize as a stakeholder. Although this particular individual may be difficult, the project manager cannot avoid him, because he has a stake in the project. The project manager can say no, but this does not solve the root cause of the problem. There may be some good ideas within those change requests.
The only choice that deals with the problem is getting the stakeholder involved in the project as soon as possible. Changes generally arise due to lack of input at the beginning of the project. If the project manager begins effective communication with this stakeholder early, there is a much better chance his changes will be discovered during the planning process, when they will have less of an impact on the project.

Q370Which of the following statements best describes how stakeholders are involved on a project?

A. They help to determine the project schedule, deliverables, and requirements.
B. They help to determine the project constraints and product deliverables.
C. They help to determine the resource needs and resource constraints on the project.
D. They approve the project charter, help provide assumptions, and create the management plans.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Stakeholder Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project manager determines the project schedule through schedule development. The team and other stakeholders provide the inputs. Since it is also the project managers role to determine resource needs and create management plans, the choices including those roles cannot be best. The project sponsor approves the project charter, not the stakeholders. Stakeholders do, however, help determine project constraints and product deliverables. Notice how tricky questions can be if you do not read them correctly! Watch for this in other questions, and pay close attention to the wording.

Answer: 



Q371You know that some groups within your organization are going to provide input to requirements that may impact your ability to develop a realistic schedule. Managing stakeholder expectations is always important, but achieving stakeholder satisfaction will be more critical with some groups than with others. All the following are parts of the teams stakeholder management effort except:

A. Determining stakeholders' needs
B. Identifying stakeholders
C. Giving stakeholders added value
D. Managing stakeholders' expectations
Correct Answer: C
Section: Stakeholder Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Identifying all the stakeholders, determining their needs, and managing their expectations are all parts of good stakeholder management. Giving stakeholders added value (including extras not documented in the requirements) is known as gold plating. This is not effective stakeholder or quality management.

Q372You are managing a project to develop an organizations new website. The site will be highly complex and interactive, and neither your project team nor the client has much experience with this type of website development.
The timeline is extremely aggressive. Any delay will be costly for both your firm and the client. You and the project sponsor have achieved agreement and sign-off on both the project charter and the project management plan. Client personnel have been kept fully informed of the projects progress through status reports and regular meetings. The project is on schedule and within budget, and a final perfunctory review has been scheduled.
Suddenly you hear that the entire effort may be cancelled because the product being developed is totally unacceptable. What is the most likely cause of this situation?

A. A key stakeholder was not adequately engaged in the project.
B. The project charter and project management plan were not thoroughly explained to or adequately reviewed by the client.
C. Communications arrangements were inadequate and did not provide the required information to interested parties.
D. The project sponsor failed to provide adequate support for the project.
Correct Answer: A
Section: Stakeholder Management
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A single high-level executive can end an entire project if they are not satisfied with the results, even if that person has, by choice, been only tangentially involved in the project. It is critical to ensure that all the final decision makers are identified and engaged early in a project in order to ensure that their concerns are addressed.

C. Send status reports to the stakeholders.
D. Update the stakeholders on the status of all project changes.
Correct Answer: A

Q391When checking the calendar of a team member to schedule a meeting, you see she has scheduled a meeting with a key stakeholder that you were not informed of. This stakeholder has been vocal in her concern that her requirements for the project have been ignored and that she doesn't think you are a good project manager. You know that the stakeholder and the team member are friends outside of the organization and that their children are in school together. Your organizations PMO has a policy stating that the project manager is to be informed of, and invited to, all project-related meetings. This is a functional organization that has struggled with communications and stakeholder participation. You have heard that the team member thinks the PMO policy regarding notifying and inviting the project manager to all meetings is intrusive and gets in the way of effective communications with stakeholders; she has also complained that project managers are not available because of multiple projects and too many meetings. She doesn't feel trusted, and is frustrated. Her complaints have been reported to other departmental leaders, and the PMO has been asked to review the policy. The best approach would be to:

A. Avoid mentioning it to the team member but continue to watch her activities.
B. Notify the PMO about the problem.
C. Address the concern with the team member's manager.
D. Address the concern with the team member.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Professional & Social Responsibility

Q396You've been assigned to take over managing a project that should be half complete according to the schedule. After an extensive evaluation, you discover the project is running far behind schedule, and will probably take twice the time originally estimated by the previous project manager. However, the sponsor has been told the project is on schedule. What is the best course of action?

A. Try to restructure the schedule to meet the project deadline.
B. Report your assessment to the sponsor.
C. Turn the project back to the previous project manager.
D. Move forward with the schedule as planned by the previous project manager, and report at the first missed milestone.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Professional & Social Responsibility
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
It is not possible to turn the project back to the previous project manager' the previous project manager may have left the company or she may be busy with new projects. That is a form of withdrawal. Moving ahead without addressing the situation also withdraws from the problem, and withdrawal is not the best choice.
There are two problems described here: the project is behind schedule, and the sponsor does not know it.
There seem to be two possible right answers: restructuring the schedule, and reporting the situation to the sponsor. You should work to get the project on schedule. However, looking only at restructuring the schedule excludes other possibilities, such as cutting scope, which might more effectively deal with the schedule problem. You do not know if the project completion date is critical. What if the sponsor would agree to change the due date? The best choice in this situation is to inform the sponsor of the revised completion time estimate, and discuss options.

A. Continue as planned; your customer has not requested a change.
B. Inform the customer of the available upgrade, and explain the impacts to the project's timeline and functionality if the upgrade is implemented.
C. Implement the change and adjust the schedule as necessary because this supports the customer's original request.
D. Implement the change on the remaining sites and continue with the schedule.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Professional & Social Responsibility
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Professional and social responsibility includes looking after the customers best interests. Therefore, ignoring the newly available upgrade cannot be best. In this case, the schedule and scope are already approved, and all changes must go through the integrated change control process. Implementing the change on any of the sites without following the process is not acceptable. The best option is to inform the customer of the available upgrade, and explain the impacts to the projects timeline and functionality if the upgrade is implemented.

A. Meet with the program manager.
B. Develop a risk control plan.
C. Discuss the issue with your manager.
D. Meet with the other project manager.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Professional & Social Responsibility
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:

Meeting with the program manager or with your boss would be the next step if meeting with the other project manager does not satisfactorily resolve the issue. You might also develop a risk response plan to deal with the risk to your project. First, though, you need to meet with the other project manager regarding those late deliverables.

A. Change the quality standards to meet the level achieved.
B. State in your reports that the concrete simply 'meets our quality needs.'
C. Ensure the remaining concrete meets the standard.
D. Report the lower quality level, and try to find a solution.
Correct Answer: D
Section: Professional & Social Responsibility
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Changing the quality standards or stating that the concrete 'meets our quality needs' would be unethical.
Ensuring that the remaining concrete meets the existing quality standards withdraws from the problem and is therefore not the best solution. The only possible choice is to report the lower quality level. That choice would involve quality and other experts to find a resolution.

B. Make sure you choose your words carefully whenever you communicate.
C. Ask one person at each team meeting to describe something unique about their culture.
D. Keep communication short and to the point.

Q408A PMP-certified project manager is contacted by PMI and asked to provide information regarding a team member, who is also a personal friend. The PMP-certified project manager cannot think of a reason he would be contacted by PMI about this individual unless someone had reported that this team member has been involved in unethical activities. The PMP-certified project manager has information that would likely support the accusations. He is thinking that the best thing to do is to not respond to avoid the risk that what he says could hurt his friend. This way he is not responsible for confirming or denying the accusations. Is this the right thing to do?

A. Yes. It is acceptable to just ignore the request and stay out of it.
B. No. He is required by PMI's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to cooperate.
C. No. It would be better to deny the charges against his friend to maintain the relationship.
D. Yes. It is best if project managers support each other in the field.
Correct Answer: B

Q409A project manager discovers a defect in a deliverable that is due to the customer under contract today. The project manager knows the customer does not have the technical understanding to notice the defect. The deliverable meets the contract requirements, but it does not meet the project manager's quality standard.
What should the project manager do in this situation?

A. Issue the deliverable, and get formal acceptance from the customer.
B. Note the problem in the lessons learned so future projects do not encounter the same problem.
C. Discuss the issue with the customer.
D. Inform the customer that the deliverable will be late.
Correct Answer: C
Section: Professional & Social Responsibility
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Issuing the deliverable with the defect does not protect the best interests of the customer. Simply noting the issue in lessons learned does not solve the problem. Informing the customer that the deliverable will be late will cause a default of contract. Although the deliverable meets the contractual requirements, it is best to bring the problem to the customer's attention so an option that does no harm can be found.

Q411Three students from another country are working as interns on a project. The project manager has arranged for some games to be played as team-building activities to help develop a stronger sense of team with the group members. At the event where the activities are taking place, the three students refuse to participate, claiming the behavior involved is unacceptable in their country and that they would be very uncomfortable participating. What should the project manager do?

A. He should tell the students they need to become familiar with how things are done in this country and they must participate.
B. He should excuse the students from participating and arrange to discuss with them alternative team- building activities they would be more comfortable with.
C. He should report the students to their functional manager and request they be removed from the project since their attitude will have a negative impact on the project.
D. He should tell the students they are excused from the activities and to not attend any teambuilding activities in the future.
Correct Answer: B
Section: Professional & Social Responsibility
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Insisting that the team members participate is forcing them to do something that is unacceptable in their culture. Requesting their removal from the project penalizes the team members for expressing their cultural preferences, which is not a valid reason to remove them. Excluding them from all future team building does not show respect for their culture, and would have a negative impact on the project. Excusing them from playing, and discussing alternative activities for the whole team with which they would be more comfortable is best because it demonstrates respect for cultural differences.
