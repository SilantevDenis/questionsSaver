Q1Your project is nearing completion, but a previously unidentified risk has arisen, and it could significantly affect one of the project deliverables.
What do you do?

A. Transfer the risk
B. Develop a risk mitigation plan
C. Include the issue in the project risk log
D. Notify the project stakeholders immediately
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

Q2James is currently managing a software upgrade project. He has recently identified and analyzed his key project stakeholders. He is now searching his organizational process assets for a template with which he can update the results of this analysis along with the planned strategies required to engage the stakeholders effectively. Which of the following should he search for?

A. Risk management plan
B. Change request form
C. Stakeholder register
D. Stakeholder engagement plan
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
A change request form is used to initiate a change in the project baselines. The risk management plan does not document the stakeholder engagement strategy. Although the stakeholder register contains stakeholder identification, classification and assessment information, it does not record the stakeholder engagement strategy. James should search for a stakeholder engagement plan template where all this information can be updated. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 522]

Q3As a project manager based at the customer location for a performing organization, you build rapport with a customer manager. As the project progresses, the manager asks you to make certain changes to the project scope and wants this handled on an informal basis. You should:

A. Contact your manager in your organization and ask for this work to be done without payment, as a goodwill gesture.
B. Comply with the manager's request. It is important to continue to maintain a good relationship with the manager.
C. Refuse to take up any changes since the manager has asked you to do it informally.
D. Explain to the manager that you would need to formally document as part of project scope change and put it through the change management process.
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The correct response is that you would explain to the manager that you would need to formally document these changes as part of project scope change and put them through the change management process.
Complying with the manager's request is incorrect and violates the code of ethics and professional responsibility. Refusing to consider changes may be too drastic a step. After you have tried to get these changes formally included in the change management process, you may consider contacting your manager in your organization. However, the decision to do work without payment involves financial considerations and will be a more involved one. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q4A large network hardware upgrade project was scheduled to take place over a weekend. During the course of the implementation, several previously unidentified dependencies on additional materials were discovered. The project manager gave approval for the tech staff doing the implementation to procure with corporate credit cards several hundred dollars' worth of additional equipment required to complete the implementation. However, these additional expenses caused the project to exceed its budget. How should the project manager handle this?

A. Notify the project stakeholders immediately of the additional expenses incurred and follow project and company procedures for budget variances.
B. Ask the IT Director to cover those expenses from his budget.
C. Advise the staff to submit expense reports for the purchases. Because the cost is relatively small, it can be categorized as miscellaneous purchases that are not associated with the project.
D. Do nothing; that's what reserves are for.
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Notifying project stakeholders and following proper procedures for dealing with budget variances is the best response. Attempting to pass off or hide an unexpected expense in another budget or in expense reports rather than following proper procedures is dishonest and unprofessional. The PMI code of ethics requires project managers to be honest, take responsibility for errors, and follow all organizational rules and policies.

Q14Rob has been assigned to manage a complex project. Rob has recently acquired his PMP certification and is excited about applying his newly acquired knowledge to his project. During the project initiation, he produced the stakeholder register and impressed his project sponsor. Rob is now about to develop the stakeholder engagement plan for his project. This has made the project sponsor a bit uncomfortable because he thinks Rob is spending too much time doing paperwork instead of actually executing the project work. The project sponsor has asked Rob to explain the difference between the stakeholder register and the stakeholder engagement plan. How should Rob respond?

A. The stakeholder register only contains basic stakeholder assessment information, while the stakeholder engagement plan includes detailed stakeholder engagement strategy that ensures project success.

Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
It must be noted that the project manager is responding to the project sponsor in order to defend a position.
The sponsor is asking for the difference between the two documents. The best response should not only clarify the difference between the two, it should also make some business sense. All of the statements are technically correct, but having a stakeholder engagement strategy to ensure success makes more business sense. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 522]

Q30Which of the following stakeholder groups, especially if the size of the group is large, is ideal for the success of the project?

A. Supportive stakeholders
B. Leading stakeholders
C. Neutral stakeholders
D. Unaware stakeholders
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Neutral and unware stakeholders usually don't pose any serious threat but they are volatile and can sway in any direction as more information becomes available to them. Leading stakeholders are beneficial for the project as long as they are limited in number. If the size of the group is large this can be damaging. The supportive stakeholders are usually low in potential to affect the project but high in potential for collaboration. This is an ideal stakeholder group that supports the project's goals and objectives. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 521] [Project Stakeholder Management]

Q38A first-time project manager was assigned to a project that had a duration of three months. In order to get a head start on the project, the manager took an older, completed the project and incorporated all the tools, techniques, and checklists in their entirety from that project into the current one. The older project was completed in 14 months' time and was remarkably similar in nature. The most appropriate comment on this would be:

A. This is an excellent example of re-use of artifacts from prior projects.
B. This may be unnecessary. The project management team needs to decide what is appropriate for the project.
C. This is not the correct procedure. The project manager should always create processes and documents afresh for new projects.
D. This is not correct. The project manager is violating copyright and intellectual property rights of the organization's prior customers.
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The correct response is that this may be unnecessary. The project management team needs to decide what is appropriate for the project. Since the prior project had a duration of 14 months and the current one is of 3 months' duration, it is unlikely that the current project will have exactly the same processes applied.
Some amount of tailoring will be required. The other responses are not valid. It cannot be said with certainty that the project manager will not be violating copyright and intellectual property rights of prior customers.
Most organizations have clear guidelines on what information can go into their organizational assets' database. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 28] [Project Framework]

Q39A first-time project manager wanted to have a "perfect project." This manager informed the customer that this project would not accept change requests of any kind and that the scope would need to be defined precisely at the very start of the project. The customer agreed to this request. What would your comment on this situation be?

A. The is a good example of how the project management team can decide what is and what is not necessary for the project. Not allowing changes is a good way of ensuring that the project meets requirements as detailed in the project scope.
B. This is unrealistic and impractical. Change is inevitable and rather than look at a 'no change' project, it would be more in the project interests to plan for a robust change control process.
C. This indicates that the project manager is very aggressive and is likely to take the project to successful completion. Since he has announced the 'no change requests' policy, the customer manager can no longer request changes.
D. This is unrealistic and impractical. The project manager should not have announced his intentions to the customer. He should have had an unofficial policy of rejecting all change requests.
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The correct response is that this is unrealistic and impractical. Change is inevitable. Rather than insist on a "no change" project, it would be more in the project's interest to plan for a robust change control process capable of handling any new changes. Mandating that there will be no changes will be ineffective. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 168] [Project Scope Management]

Q42A project is contracted on a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis. The targeted cost is US$200,000 with a fee of US$30,000. If the project comes in at US$170,000, what would be the total cost of the contract?

A. US$ 195,500
B. US$230,000
C. US$ 200,000
D. US$170,000
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
In a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) type of contract, the seller is reimbursed for allowable costs and receives a fixed fee payment calculated as a percentage of the estimated project costs. The fixed fee does not vary with actual costs unless the project scope changes. In the current scenario, the fixed fee is US$30,000.
Although the actual project comes in at US$170,000, the fixed fee remains the same. Hence, the total cost of the contract will be 170,000 + 30,000 = 200,000. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 472] [Project Procurement Management]

Q43A project is contracted on a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) basis. The contract states that if the final costs are less than expected costs, the sharing formula for cost savings is 80:20. The targeted cost is US$500,000 with a 10 percent fee. If the project comes in at US$450,000, what would be the total cost of the contract?

A. US$495,000
B. US$510,000
C. US$505,000
D. US$550,000
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
In a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) type of contract, the seller is reimbursed for allowable costs for performing the contract work and receives a predetermined fee. In some cases, if the final costs are less than the expected costs, then both the buyer and the seller benefit from the cost saving based on a pre- negotiated sharing formula. In the current situation, the predetermined fee is 10% of US$500,000 = US$50,000. Since the project came in at US$450,000, the cost saving is 500,000 450,000 = 50,000. The sharing formula is 80:20, hence the additional payout to the seller = (20/100)*50,000 = 10,000. Therefore, the total cost of the contract = 450,000 + 50,000 + 10,000 = US$510,000.

Q44A project is contracted on a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis with a fee of 10 percent of estimated costs. The estimated cost is US$50,000. If the project comes in at US$75,000 with no changes in project scope, what would be the total cost of the contract?

A. US$55,000
B. US$125,000
C. US$75,000
D. US$80,000
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
In the Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) type of contract, the seller is reimbursed for allowable costs for performing the contract work and receives a fee calculated as an agreed-upon percentage of the costs. The costs vary depending on the actual cost. The fee is based on estimated costs unless the scope of the project changes. For the current project, the agreed-upon percentage of costs is 10%. The actual cost is US$75,000 even though the initial estimate was US$50,000. However, the fee is calculated as 10% of 50,000 = (10/100)*50,000 = 5,000. The total cost of the contract is 75,000 + 5,000 = US$80,000. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 472] [Project Procurement Management]

Q47A seller was notified they were one of the selected sellers based on their proposal. The seller immediately circulated an internal newsletter stating they had just been awarded a large contract for a period of five years. Would the newsletter be factually correct?

A. The newsletter is likely factually incorrect. A selected seller is one whose proposal has been accepted, and a contract has been completed pending signatures of the authorized parties.
B. It is likely that the newsletter is factually incorrect. While the seller has been selected for the work, it is unlikely that the term of the project would have been five years.
C. It is likely that the newsletter is factually incorrect. A selected seller is one whose proposal is judged to be in a competitive range. It does not mean they have the work.
D. The newsletter is likely factually correct. A selected seller is one who has a contract based on the procurement process.
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The newsletter will probably be factually incorrect. A selected seller is one whose proposal has been judged to be in the competitive range based on bid evaluation. The seller would have negotiated a draft contract that could become the actual contract when the award is made. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 488]

Q48You have been asked by your project manager to help create a chart that illustrates the project resources that will be working on each work package. What would be the best type of chart to use?

A. Milestone chart
B. RACI chart
C. Project organization chart
D. WBS
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consult, and Inform. This is a type of responsibility assignment matrix that is used to illustrate the relationship between team members and work that needs to be completed. In a RACI chart, a matrix is created with work packages in the rows and team member roles in the columns. Typically, a RACI chart assumes that one person will be accountable for a work package, and more than one person may be responsible for completing the work package.

Q49As the project manager of a development project, you are aware that there is a slight defect in the developed product; as a result, it will fail to meet certain regulatory standards. This was due to faulty requirements. You are also aware that the product will continue to function properly even though it fails to meet those standards. Your customer manager asks you to certify that the product meets the necessary regulatory standards, stating that this will not be verified when the report is submitted to the necessary authorities. Your stance is that:

A. You certify the product. Regulations are only guidelines in the industry. Not meeting a regulation does not mean anything.
B. As a one-off instance, you will certify the product to make sure the project goes through successfully.
C. You will not certify that a product meets certain regulations when it does not, even though the product continues to function well.
D. You certify the product, but you document your conversation with your customer manager for future purposes.
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Your stance will be that you will not certify that a product meets required standards when it does not, even though the product continues to function well. The customer manager might not be pleased with your stance. As a Project Manager, however, you have an obligation to uphold ethical practices, and so you cannot certify a product that fails to meet required standards.
