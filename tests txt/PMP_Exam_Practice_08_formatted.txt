Q49Robert is managing a road construction project. Due to unseasonal weather conditions, the team productivity might be above or below target. This is an example of:

A. Ambiguity risk
B. Variability risk
C. Mitigated risk
D. Opportunity risk
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 398] [Project Risk Management]

Q50Which of the following is NOT a valid WBS creation approach:

A. Parametric approach
B. Top-down approach
C. Use of organizational guidelines
D. Use of WBS templates
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
A WBS structure may be created through various approaches. Some of the popular methods include the top-down approach, the use of organization-specific guidelines, and the use of WBS templates. Parametric approach is an estimation technique and not a valid WBS creation technique. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 159] [Project Risk Management]

Q51Project performance measurements assess the magnitude of variation from the original cost baseline. Once the degree of cost variation is known, what step is performed next?

A. Audit the project team
B. Upgrade the configuration management database with new controls.
C. Replanning
D. Perform root cause analysis of the variance's cause relative to the cost baseline Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Project performance measurements are used to assess the magnitude of variation. Important aspects of project cost control include determining the cause of variance relative to the cost baseline. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 262] [Project Scope Management]
