Q17Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential impact on the project. A project manager prepared a display chart of sensitivity analysis for his project. The diagram contained a series of bars with the length of the bars corresponding to the risk impact on the project. The longer the bar, the greater was the risk presented. Such a chart is likely to be:

A. An assessment diagram
B. A triangular distribution
C. A tornado diagram
D. A funnel distribution
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The chart is likely to be a tornado diagram. Tornado diagrams are useful for comparing relative importance and impact of variables that have a high degree of uncertainty to those that are more stable. The variables are positioned vertically, and the bars extend horizontally. The longest bar is at the top of the chart, and the shortest bar is at the bottom. This resembles the shape of a tornado; hence the name. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 434] [Project Risk Management]

Q32You are working in Lab-X, a laboratory experimental project to research the effect of a virus on human male bodies. This project needs local government approval for carrying out tests on living people. However, the local authorities informed you were informed it would take at least three weeks to obtain authorization for such approval because of the documents involved in the review and approval process. You consider this a risk to the project and would like to send the paperwork in advance to reduce the approval time to one week. Which of the following describes the risk response techniques being employed in this scenario?

A. Risk mitigation
B. Risk transfer
C. Risk accept
D. Risk avoid
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
You want to reduce the delay in the approval process because delay in the approval process is likely to delay the project. Because this is a negative risk, the valid risk response strategies are avoid, transfer, mitigate or accept. Risk mitigation techniques can be used to reduce the probability and impact of negative risks rather than trying to repair the damage after the risk has occurred. In this case, you are reducing the approval time by sending paperwork early to avoid delays in the project. Hence, risk mitigation is the correct answer. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 443]
