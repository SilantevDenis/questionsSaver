Q6Christine is managing a healthcare software development project. At a PMI conference, she met George, who is the project manager at a competing organization. George, a PMP, has managed many successful healthcare-related software development projects.

A. No! George is a project manager at a competitor organization.
B. Yes! All participants at a PMI conference are experts.
C. Yes! George is an expert in managing such projects.
D. No! This would be an example of expert opinion and not expert judgment.
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)

George is giving an expert opinion; this is analogous to expert judgment. A PMP-certified project manager from a competitor would not normally give false information. This can be considered expert judgment since George has managed many similar projects. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 79] [Project Stakeholder Management]

Q7Sandra is managing a new supersonic aircraft design project. This is a massive project, and its success is hugely important for her organization. For such mission-critical projects, which of the following is the most desirable engagement level for all major stakeholders?

A. Resistant stakeholders
B. Leading stakeholders
C. Neutral stakeholders
D. Supportive stakeholders
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

In practice, this is often unachievable; nevertheless, it is the most desirable state for all major stakeholders. On the other hand, if all key stakeholders assume a leading role, this could lead to serious and substantial conflicts. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 521] [Project Stakeholder Management]

Q9Greg's project is in the initiating stage. The sponsor of the project has asked Greg to present a list of the identified project stakeholders at the next project update meeting. The sponsor has also asked Greg to present the project stakeholders' current and desired engagement levels so they can brainstorm on the stakeholder engagement strategy. Which of the following is a presentation tool that can help Greg summarize all this information in a tabular format?

A. Communications management plan
B. Stakeholder register
C. Stakeholder engagement assessment matrix
D. Stakeholder engagement plan
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Both the communications and stakeholder management plans are detailed textual documents. They are not presentation tools. On the other hand, both the stakeholder register and the stakeholders engagement assessment matrix contain the required information. However, the stakeholders engagement assessment is the best tool to be selected in this situation since it presents the information required by the project sponsor in a tabular format.

Q10Diana is managing the development of a mobile phone application. Half the project work has been completed. Diana is currently reviewing her stakeholder engagement plan. She finds that some of the resisting stakeholders have now become supportive. How should Diana update her stakeholder engagement plan?

A. Do not update the stakeholder engagement plan at this stage since things are getting better.
B. Transfer these stakeholders to the project supporters group, and for these stakeholders, adopt the stakeholder engagement strategy defined for the project supporters.
C. For these stakeholders, continue with the defined resisting stakeholder engagement strategy since this strategy has produced positive results so far.
D. Transfer these stakeholders to the project supporters group but continue with the defined resisting stakeholder engagement strategy with these stakeholders.
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The stakeholder engagement plan should be reviewed regularly. Since some of the resistant project stakeholders have now become project supporters, this implies that the current stakeholder classification in the stakeholder engagement plan is no longer accurate. These stakeholders should now be transferred to the project supporters group, and going forward the stakeholder engagement strategy defined for project supporters should be adopted for these stakeholders. Although the stakeholder engagement strategy for the resisting stakeholders has delivered impressive results, it should only be applied to the current resistant stakeholders.
