Q1As a project manager, you would like to show the relationship between two variables to help your project team understand the quality impacts better. Which tool should be used?

A. Ishikawa Diagram
B. Eishbone Diagram
C. Histogram
D. Scatter Diagram
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A scatter diagram (and are sometimes called correlation charts) plots several occurrences of two variables (one on each axis). Often a relationship between the two variables (dependent variable and independent variable) can then be determined, based on how closely they fit a geometric model. Options A, and B.
Cause-and-Effect Diagrams Cause-and-effect diagrams (also known as fishbone diagrams). This diagram is also called a why-why diagram, or an lshikawa diagram after its developer, Kaoru lshikawa, this diagram shows the relationship between the effects of problems and their causes and help identify the root cause of the problem. This diagram depicts every potential cause and sub cause of a problem and the effect they have on the problem. The causes of the problem make up the fish bones on this diagram, and the effect is shown as the head of the fish. These diagrams can be depicted horizontally (with the head or effect to the right) or vertically (with the head or effect on top). Each of the branches that extend from the spine lists a cause. All of the issues that contribute to that cause are shown as offshoots on the branch. Engage your subject matter experts in a brainstorming session to outline the causes. This visual representation of cause- and-effect is helpful when you do not have quantitative data available to help analyze the problem. Option
E. Histograms can show the number of defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each process is noncompliant, or other representations of project or product defects.

B. Assign double the work and tell him to report the progress at the beginning and end of the day
C. Return the team member to the functional manager and warn the team member
D. Remove the team member from your project
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The most correct response is to first provide training to your team member to educate him how to perform the project objectives (tasks). Provide training where you might need it than think they have got someone fully experienced with the project or industry techniques needed for a project when they do not. Provide training regarding the project objectives and the company culture as well. Perhaps you have a team member who is ready to make the jump into a lead role but she does not have any experience at lead work.
Give him/her some exposure by assigning her a limited amount of activities in a lead capacity, provide her with some training if needed, and be available to coach and mentor where needed. The best option is to work with the management team to provide this person with the development she needs prior to the start of the project (if you are lucky enough to know early on who your resources might be and what their existing skills are). Training includes all activities designed to enhance the competencies of the project team members. Training can be formal or informal. Examples of training methods include classroom, online, computer-based, on-the-job training from another project team member, mentoring, and coaching. If project team members lack the necessary management or technical skills, such skills can be developed as part of the project work. Scheduled training takes place as stated in the resource management plan. Unplanned training takes place as a result of observation, conversation, and project performance appraisals conducted during management of the project team. Training costs could be included in the project budget or supported by the performing organization if the added skills may be useful for future projects. It may be performed by in-house or by external trainers. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 342]

If you have taken earned value measurements, the SV and SPI will be helpful in determining the impact of the schedule variations and in determining whether corrective actions are necessary. What-if scenario analysis is used to assess the various scenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into alignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.
Option D. What-if scenario analysis. What if the situation represented by scenario X happens? A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute the different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations, or introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. Option D. Variance analysis, comparing what was planned to what actually executed. Option B. Earned value analysis (EVA) is an analysis technique that compares the actual schedule and cost to the performance measurement baseline. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 227]

This translates to defining and defending scope, identifying, analyzing, planning responses and monitoring and controlling risks, proactively planning and delivering Quality, etc. And, as the PMBOK Guide suggests, managing communications with the stakeholders would also be a key part of this process. Everything we do should be from the point of view of expectation management. In short, expectations management IS project management! [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 524]

Q34Mark is a project manager working on a compliance project in a banking firm. The project scheduled for completion six weeks from now. The project sponsor has told mark that if the project finished sooner, the company could receive some monetary incentives offered by the government. What would be the effect if Mark decided to fast-track the project?

A. Cannot be determined
B. Increase risk in the project
C. Not affect the project risk
D. Decrease risk in the project
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
East tracking can occur for the entire duration of the task or phase or a portion of the task or phase duration. It can increase project risk and might cause the project team to have to rework tasks. Fast- tracking will work only for activities that can be overlapped. For example, it is often performed in object- oriented programming. The programmers might begin writing code on several modules at once, out of sequential order and prior to the completion of the design phase. However, if you remember our house- painting example, you could not start priming and painting at the same time, so fast tracking is not a possibility for those activities.

Q35You take over for a project manager who has left the company because he failed to send the status of the project to the project stakeholders, and you realize that the team is talking directly to the sponsor and having status meetings only when there is an issue. Which document is the FIRST one that you should create to solve this problem?

A. Plan Stakeholder engagement
B. Project Management plan
C. Change Management plan
D. Communications Management plan
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The Communications Management plan is the first thing you need to create in this situation. It will help you organize the meetings that are taking place and get everyone on the same page. The communications management plan may also include guidelines for conducting status meetings, team meetings, and so on.
According to the PMBOK Guide-6th Edition, the communications management plan typically describes the following elements: 1) The communication requirements of each stakeholder or stakeholder group Purpose for communication. 2) Frequency of communications, including time frames for distribution. 3) Escalation process. 4) Name of the person responsible for communicating information along with the person responsible for authorizing the communication and the recipients. 5) Format of the communication and method of transmission. 6) Method for updating the communications management plan 7) Flowcharts. 8) Glossary of common terms. 9) Constraints that might impact communication such as legislation, technology, or organizational policies. 10) For the exam (at least 8 Questions related to the communications management plan), know that the communications management plan documents how the communication needs of the stakeholders will be met, including the types of information that will be communicated, who will communicate it, who receives the communication, the methods used to communicate, the timing and frequency, the method for updating this plan as the project progresses, the escalation process, and a glossary of common terms.

Q36As a project manager, you are ensuring that the quality management process is followed on your project. However, failure to meet the quality requirements can have serious negative consequences for any or all of the stakeholders. During a project update meeting, one of the key stakeholders expressed his displeasure over the project management approach. One of the produced deliverables had major defects which required a rework. Defects in the produced deliverables cause rework which costs the company S 2000.This rework has increased costs, and you are beginning to notice some signs of poor morale because of the rework. Which of the following statements is true?

A. The problems occurred because the WBS was not constructed properly
B. The quality assurance plan was carried out correctly, which is bow tbe defects were discovered by the key stakeholder
C. The Plan Risk Management process details these kinds of risks and the responses you should put into place should the risk events occur
D. The problems occurred as a result of poor scope definition Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Poor scope definition can result in increased costs, rework, and poor morale. There is no quality assurance plan, and the Plan Risk Management process details how the risk management processes will be identified, managed, and controlled throughout the project. One of the outputs of Validate Scope is accepted deliverables that are formally signed off and approved by the authorized stakeholder. Therefore, the stakeholder needs to get involved early on during planning (sometimes initiating as well) and to provide inputs about quality of deliverables so that Control Quality can assess the performance and recommend necessary changes.

Q37You are about to contract out a project to a service provider. However, at the time of awarding the contract, you are not sure of the total effort involved. Since the scope of work cannot be accurately estimated, you want to agree upon the per unit rates for different services. Which of the following contracts would best suit your purpose?

A. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)
B. Time and Material
C. Fixed Price (FP)
D. Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF)
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Time and materials contracts are a cross between fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. The full amount of the material costs is not known at the time the contract is awarded. This resembles a cost- reimbursable contract because the costs will continue to grow during life of the project and are reimbursable to the contractor. The buyer bears the biggest risk in this type of contract. Time and materials contracts can resemble fixed-price contracts when unit rates are used, for example. Unit rates might be used to preset the rates of certain elements or portions of the project. For example, a contracting agency might charge you $150 per hour for a .NET programmer, or a leasing company might charge you $2,000 per month for the hardware you are leasing during the testing phase of your project. These rates are preset and agreed upon by the buyer and seller ahead of time. Time and materials contracts are most often used when you need human resources with specific skills and when you can quickly and precisely define the scope of work needed for the project.

Q38You are a project manager for a manufacturing company, and you want to assess the current quality of your production process. You also want to check if the process is stable over time or if there are any special causes of variation. Which of the following tools would be most suitable for this purpose?

A. Control chart
B. Scatter Diagram
C. Inspection
D. Run chart
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Control charts measure the results of processes over time and display the results in graph form. Control charts are a way to measure variances to determine whether process variances are in control or out of control. A control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen and measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Control Quality is usually maintained - or said to be in control - within plus or minus three standard deviations. In other words, Control Quality says that if the process is in control (that is, the measurements fall within the control limits), you know that 99.73 percent of the parts going through the process will fall within an acceptable range of the mean. If you discover a part outside of this range, you should investigate and determine whether corrective action is needed. The Rule of 7 is another way for the project team to use control charts and determine if the process is in control. The Rule of 7 works like this. If seven consecutive points or more fall on one side of the mean, this may indicate there are factors influencing the result, and they should be investigated. So, while the overall results are within the control limits, the process may not necessarily be in control, and those factors should be examined more closely. When a process is in control, it should not be adjusted.
When a process falls outside the acceptable limits, it should be adjusted. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 304]

Q41You are working on a project with all the team members located in geographically different areas. Although the number of working hours per week for each team is 40 hours, you find team members in one country are only working 30 hours a week. As a project manager, what should you implement next?

A. Ground rules
B. Recognition and rewards
C. Co-location
D. Training
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Ground rules are defined in the team charter and are expectations set by the project manager and project team that describe acceptable team behavior. For example, one of my friends is team members who interrupt each other. In this case, one of the ground rules is one person speaks at a time during a meeting, another example, a team member leaves the project early. In this case, one of the ground rules is to identify the number of working hours such as; 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Monday-Friday, and 40 hours a week. Outlining ground rules like this helps the team understand expectations regarding acceptable behavior and increases productivity. Ground rules should also include expectations for stakeholder engagement. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 50, and 528]

A. Variance and trend analysis
B. Process improvement plan
C. Risk audit
D. Risk re-assessment
Correct Answer: C

Risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of the risk process. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the risk management plan. For the exam, the important thing to know about risk audits is that they are focused on overall risk management process. In other word, they are more about the top-down process than they are more about individual risks. Periodic risk audits evaluate how the risk management plan and the risk response plan are working as the project progresses and whether or not the risks that were identified and prioritized are actually occurring.

Q45The Project Stakeholder Management knowledge area is focused on engaging the stakeholders in the project. As you have been managing your project, you found out that one of the key stakeholders of the company is resisting the project. As a project manager, what must you do first?

A. Analyze options that might change or influence the key stakeholder perception
B. Conduct a team meeting to discuss this issue
C. Seek support from the project sponsor to force project decisions
D. Seek expert judgment from the project initiator
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
One of the most common challenges project managers face is stakeholder resistance. The ability to influence others is at the heart of project management. However, it is not so much about persuading stakeholders, but rather about incorporating and orchestrating them into the greater project setting. The key stakeholders must be turned into a project supporter in order to ensure success. Any of the given choices can be the solution to this problem. However, you should first identify all the available options and analyze them before selecting the best option. When a stakeholder is resistant to your project, you will need to negotiate with her/him and understand herihis resistance so that you can take herihis perspective into account. Sometimes a stakeholder you do not always talk to might have a good suggestion for an improvement that can help the whole project. It is also possible that there are some facts about the project that the stakeholder has not considered, and you can help him to be better informed. The key to success in Stakeholder Management is being inclusive, and sharing information with everyone who is impacted by outcomes of the project. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 521, 522]

Q50You are a Project Manager for a construction project and are looking for all possible information before the phase of project initiation. Which is the best source of information for your project?

A. Organizational process assets
B. WBS
C. Project charter
D. Business plans
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Organizational process assets and historical information should be reviewed and examined when a new project is starting. Historical information can be useful to project managers and to stakeholders. When you are evaluating new projects, historical information about previous projects of a similar nature can be handy in determining whether the new project should be accepted and initiated. Historical information gathered and documented during an active project is used to assist in determining whether the project should proceed to the next phase. Historical information will help you with the project charter, project scope statement, and development of the project management plan, the process of defining and estimating activities, and more during the project-planning processes. Understanding previous projects of a similar nature-their problems, successes, issues, and outcomes-will help you avoid repeating mistakes while reusing successful techniques to accomplish the goals of this project to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.
Many of the processes in the project management process groups have organizational process assets as an input, implying that you should review the pertinent organizational assets that apply for the process you are about to start. For example, when performing the Estimate Costs process, you might find it helpful to review the activity estimates and budgets on past projects of similar size and scope before estimating the costs for the activities on the new project.

Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The question asks about the schedule management plan which is a component of the project management plan. The schedule management plan serves to describe how the project schedule will be developed, monitored, controlled, and changed. What makes this question challenging is that the schedule management plan is not listed as an answer choice. There will likely be instances on the actual PMP exam where the obvious answer is not available, and the best option of the available responses must be selected.
In this case, the schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan. Therefore, among the available choices, project management plan is the best answer to the question asked. One common reason people answer incorrectly is they do not read all four choices. Do not make the same mistake! Make sure you read the question and all four choices when you take the exam. This will help you select the BEST answer. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 181]

A. Kickoff meeting
B. Develop the project charter
C. Feasibility studies
D. Risk re-assessment
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Feasibility studies are undertaken for several reasons. One is to determine whether the project is a viable project. A second reason is to determine the probability of the project succeeding. The study might also look at the technical issues related to the project and determine whether the technology proposed is feasible, reliable, and easily assimilated into the organizational existing technology structure. Feasibility studies are typically conducted as the first phase of a project, but they might also be conducted as separate projects or subprojects. When you do not have any preconceived ideas about the outcome of the study, it is best to treat it as a separate project. The group of people conducting the feasibility study should not be the same people who will work on the project. The project manager and Project team members might have built-in biases toward the project and will tend to influence the feasibility outcome toward those biases.
Before you take that plunge, you should know that some organizations will require a feasibility study prior to making a final decision about starting the project. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 30, and 125]

Q66You are working with your team to evaluate the likelihood of risk occurrences and their consequences using a numerical rating. In what process you are participating?

A. Risk register
B. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
C. Plan Risk Responses
D. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis analyzes the probability of risks and their consequences using a numerical rating. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis might use numeric ratings but can use a high-medium- low scale as well. For the exam, understand the differences between the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis processes for the exam. The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. This process is not needed on every project, but when you do use it, it is typically performed for risks identified in Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis that could have a significant impact on the project. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis quantifies the aggregate risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric probabilities to risks and their impacts on project objectives. This quantitative approach is accomplished using techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation and decision tree analysis. Option D. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis determines the impact the identified risks will have on the project and the probability they will occur, and it puts the risks in priority order according to their effects on the project objectives. Option C. Plan Risk Responses is the process where risk response plans are developed using strategies such as escalate, avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept, exploit, share, enhance, develop contingent response strategies, and apply expert judgment. The risk response plan describes the actions to take should the identified risks occur. It should include all the identified risks, a description of the risks, how they will impact the project objectives, and the people assigned to manage the risk responses. Option A. The risk register is an output of the Identify Risks process, and updates to the risk register occur as an output of every risk process that follows this one. By the end of the Plan Risk Responses process, the risk register contains these primary elements:
identified list of risks, risk owners, risk triggers, risk strategies, contingency plans, and contingency reserves. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 419,428, and 437]

Answer: 



Q67After brainstorming potential project risks, what is the recommended method for prioritizing these risks and their mitigation plans?

A. RACI chart
B. Control chart
C. Fishbone Diagram
D. Probability and impact matrix
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A probability and impact matrix prioritize the combination of probability and impact scores and helps you determine which risks need detailed risk response plans. For example, a risk event with a high probability of occurring and a high impact will likely need a response plan. This matrix is typically defined by the organization, but if you do not have one, you will need to develop this now - during your planning meetings (a tool and technique of this process). You will use this matrix in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process, and I will talk more in depth about it in the section Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques.
Again, you want to define (or modify) and document the probability and impact matrix in the risk management plan. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 472]

Answer: 



Q68The project manager is in the process of developing risk responses. While dealing with a particular risk, the project manager discovers that it cannot be avoided, accepted or mitigated. The project manager decides to escalate this risk to the project sponsor. In which of the following would you find information about an escalation matrix?

A. Risk response plan
B. Risk management plan
C. Risk register
D. Project management plan
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The question asks about communication management plan which is a component of the project management plan. The Escalation Matrix and communication process are a portion of the communication management plan. An Escalation Matrix (not mentioned in the PMBOK Guide 6th edition, but this is an important concept you may need to know for the actual exam) details how Project Issues will be handled and at what level. What gets handled by the PM? What gets raised to the stakeholder group? What makes this question challenging is that communication management plan is not listed as an answer choice. There will likely be instances on the actual PMP exam where the obvious answer is not available, and the best option of the available responses must be selected. In this case, the communication management plan is a component of the project management plan. Therefore, among the available choices, project management plan is the best answer to the question asked. Option A. The risk response plans detail the strategies you will use to respond to risk and assign individuals to manage each risk response. Option B. The Risk Management Plan captures information on how risk management will be performed for the project. This includes risk management roles and responsibilities, risk categories, timing, and risk strategy. Option C.
The risk register is an output of the Identify Risks process. It is a list of identified risks, their potential responses, and their Potential risk owners. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 377, 405, 417 and page 418]

Q71You are a senior project manager and member of the Project Management Office. The CIO wants you to present a snapshot of the status of various projects going on in the organization. Which of the following charts would be most suitable for the purpose?

A. The milestone chart for this project
B. The network diagram for this project
C. Copies of the most recent status report from the team members
D. The project charter
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Milestone charts are useful for communicating high-level status on a project. A milestone chart, as the name implies, only represents key events (milestones) for the project. Milestones may be significant events or deliverables by you or external parties on the project. Milestone charts, because of the general level of information they provide, should be reserved for brief, high level project presentations where a lot of schedule detail would be undesirable or even distracting. This represents the best of the 4 choices. Option
E. would be far too much detail for an executive status meeting. Option C. would not be a bad thing to bring, but it would not be the best document for showing status. Option D. would not provide the status that the CIO seeks. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 218]

A. Reduce the technical requirements so that the error is no longer valid
B. Develop alternative solutions to address the error
C. Go forward with production and ignore the error
D. Go forward with production, but inform the customer of the problem Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The best answer to this problem is to develop alternative solutions to address the design error. Reducing technical requirements might be an alternative solution, but it is not one you would implement without looking at all the alternatives. Ignoring the error and going forward with production will result in an unsatisfactory product for the customer. So, your responsibility is to resolve issues and determine alternative solutions to problems as they occur without changing the original objectives of the project. Use some of the techniques such as brainstorming andior the Delphi technique, to find solutions. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 490]

For the exam, Expert judgment is an important tool and technique in the Develop Project Charter process, and the Develop the Project Management Plan process. The concept behind expert judgment is to rely on individuals, or groups of people, who have training, specialized knowledge, or skills in the areas you' re assessing. These folks might be stakeholders, consultants, and other experts in the organization, subject matter experts, the PMO, industry experts, or technical or professional organizations. According to the PMBOK Guide -6th. Edition, you should utilize experts who have knowledge or training in the following:
organizational strategy, management, technical industry knowledge, estimating techniques for duration and cost, and risk identification. Expert judgment is a tool and technique used in other processes as well. In the case of developing a project charter, expert judgment would be helpful in assessing the inputs of this process, the environmental factors, organizational assets, and historical information. For example, as the project manager, you might rely on the expertise of your executive committee to help you understand how the proposed project gels with the strategic plan, or you might rely on team members who have participated on similar projects in the past to make recommendations regarding the proposed project.

A. Direct/Forcing
B. Smoothing
C. Collaborate
D. Compromise
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Option A.
Force (direct) - in this technique one person pushes their viewpoint at the expense of another. This will lead to a win-lose solution. This technique may be the best technique in an emergency, especially an emergency that deals with safety or security. Option B. Collaborate (problem solving) - in this technique we work with the other party to find a win-win. While this method may take more time than the others, it often leads to a more beneficial result for both parties. For this method to work, a high level of trust in each other and commitment to resolving the conflict needs to be present and need face to face communication. Option C.
Withdrawal (avoid) - in this technique we walk away from a conflict. If we walk away with the idea to never address the conflict, this is very bad. If we walk away to calm down, or be better prepared with facts then a temporary withdrawal can be a good thing. Option D. A compromise requires searching for options that bring some degree to satisfaction to all parties in order to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This would be the best way to handle the current situation as the difference of time zone is not under the control of anyone. This may result in a lose-lose situation. On the positive side, if the conflict is not that important or if a quick resolution is required. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 349]

A. Communications management plan
B. Business need
C. Project charter
D. Work performance data
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Since you are in the execution phase and stakeholders are requesting project information about the information flow in the project, so you must respond through the Manage Communications process. The communications management plan is input to this process. You can use the communications management plan to respond to their requests. The Communications Management plans contains the following information: Flow charts of the information flow in the project, workfiows with possible sequence of authorization, list of reports, meeting plans, etc.; and Constraints derived from specific legislation or regulation, technology, organizational policies, etc. The business need and the project charter are not of much help at this stage.

Q96Which document contains a predefined set of risk categories you can use to determine both individual risks and overall project risks?

A. Risk triggers
B. Risk prompt list
C. Risk register
D. Risk report
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A prompt list is somewhat similar to a checklist in that you have a predefined set of risk categories you can use to determine both individual risks and overall project risks. You can use the lowest level of the RBS to construct a prompt list for individual risks. According to the PMBOK Guide 6th edition, you could consult strategic analysis tools to assist in determining overall project risk such as PESTLE, TECOP, or VUCA.
PESTLE analysis examines political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors to see if they may have an overall project impact. TECOP analysis looks at technical, environmental, commercial, operational, and political risks. Like in the earlier example, you should examine each of these elements to determine if there are overall project risks that could impact the project. VUCA analysis looks at volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. Option A. Risk triggers. Triggers are warning signs or symptoms that a risk event is about to occur. For example, if you are planning an outdoor gathering and rain clouds start rolling in from the north on the morning of the activity, you probably have a risk event waiting to happen. A key team member hinting about job hunting is a warning sign that the person might be thinking of leaving, which in turn can cause schedule delays, increased costs, and so on. Option D. The risk report is created and elaborated on as you work through the risk processes in the Planning process group.
It documents all the sources of overall project risk, including those that have the highest potential for impacting the project. It also contains high-level information about the potential individual risks that exist on the project, including the number of risks, types of risk categories represented by the risks, and so on.

Q97In your project, you have identified several threats to the quality of the project. To understand which threats should be managed more closely, you employ a technique to rank them after gathering information about the threats from stakeholders, what is this technique called?

A. Probability and impact matrix
B. Expert judgment
C. Mind mapping
D. Monte Carlo simulation
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The probability and impact matrix takes the probability and impact values one step further by assigning an overall risk score classification to each of the identified risks. The combination of probability and impact results in a classification usually expressed as high, medium, or low. Typically, high risks are considered a red condition, medium risks are considered a yellow condition, and low risks are considered a green condition. This type of ranking is known as an ordinal scale because the values are ordered by rank from high to low. (In practice, ordinal values might also include ranking by position. In other words, the risks are listed in order by rank as the first, the second, the third, and so on.) Remember that probability and impact can be determined for the risk as a whole, or for components of the project the risk may affect, such as the project schedule, cost, and quality. Option B. When evaluating risk, use experts who understand the tools associated with analyzing risk, including the benefits and drawbacks of the tools or methods you will use.
For example, if your project involves manufacturing a new Car, you might want to consider experts such as engineers or statisticians. Option C. Mind mapping is used to visually organize information about stakeholders and their relationship to each other and the organization. Option D. Monte Carlo Simulation.
An analysis technique where a computer model is iterated many times, with the input values chosen at random for each iteration driven by the input data, including probability distributions and probabilistic branches. Outputs are generated to represent the range of possible outcomes for the project. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 425, 521, and 711]

Q98You are showing your project team members the organizational structure, and you point out where in the structure their role is located. What tool would be useful to you in preparing this information?

A. Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)
B. Work breakdown structure (WBS)
C. Organizational breakdown structure (OBS)
D. Resource breakdown structure (RBS)
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The organizational breakdown structure (OBS) is arranged according to an organization, existing departments, units, or teams with the project activities or work packages listed under each department.
Option A. Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) Matrix-based charts are used to show the type of resources and the responsibility they have on the project. It is used to illustrate the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. Option D. The resource breakdown structure (RBS) is much like an organizational breakdown structure, but the RBS lists the resources by category and type. You may have several categories of resources, including labor, hardware, equipment, supplies, and so on. Type describes the types of resources needed, such as skill levels or quality grades of the material and so on. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 316, and page 317]

Q100You are new to project management, but you are successfully managing a small project. Now, you want to conduct the Kick-off meeting for your small project. At what stage will the kickoff meeting be held?

A. Initiating
B. Planning
C. Executing
D. Closing
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The PMBOK Guide-6th Edition, notes that kickoff meeting may occur in two different places in the project, depending on its size. 1) A small project generally involves a small project team who are actively involved in the Planning processes, so it makes sense to hold the kickoff meeting now (in planning process). 2) For large projects, a kickoff meeting is typically held in the Executing process group because the project manager and a few key team members will perform most of the planning before assigning other resources.
Note: If the project is not mentioned is a large or small project, you must select the planning process as the best answer according to the PMI- PMP Exam content outline-planning domain-task # 12. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 86]

Q101You are a project manager managing a project. The Sponsor is particularly interested in reviewing the roles and responsibilities of team members on the project. When writing the roles and responsibilities for team members, you should document the role, authority, responsibility, and competency for each team member.
Where must you document this information?

A. Resource breakdown structure (RBS)
B. Resource management plan
C. Resource calendar
D. Work breakdown structure (WBS)
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Information regarding team roles, responsibilities, authorities and competencies is documented in the Resource Management Plan. Option (A) the resource breakdown structure (RBS) is much like an organizational breakdown structure, but the RBS lists the resources by category and type. You may have several categories of resources, including labor, hardware, equipment, supplies, and so on. Type describes the types of resources needed, such as skill levels or quality grades of the material and so on. Option (C) the resource calendars input describes the time frames in which resources (both human and material) are available. They outline work days, normal business hours, shift-work hours if they apply, and days off such as holidays or non-work days like weekends. They look at a particular resource or groups of resources and their skills, abilities, quantity, and availability. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing resource and the person assigned to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in October. The resource calendar would show vacation schedule of the team. Resource calendars also examine the quantity, capability, and availability of equipment and material resources that have a potential to impact the project schedule. Option

Risk reassessment is a technique that involves reevaluating project risks and identifying new risks that arise as the project moves forward. These risks are evaluated and placed in the risk register. The PMBOK recommends conducting risk reassessments during team meetings as a part of the Monitor Risks process.
Reassessment of risks should be a regular activity performed by everyone involved on the project. Meetings that can be used during this process include but are not limited to risk reviews. Risk reviews are scheduled regularly and should examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk and with identified individual project risks. Risk reviews may also result in identification of new individual project risks, (including secondary risks that arise from agreed-upon risk responses), reassessment of current risks, the closing of risks that are outdated, issues that have arisen as the result of risks that have occurred, and identification of lessons to be learned for implementation in ongoing phases in the current project or in similar projects in the future. The risk review may be conducted as part of a periodic project status meeting or a dedicated risk review meeting may be held, as specified in the risk management plan.

Q114You are managing a construction project. The project customer requests a small change to the project that should not pose a threat to the quality of the project. As the project manager, what should you do next?

A. Submit the change request to change control board (CCB)
B. Make the change as soon as possible - it is small and you should respond appropriately for the customer
C. Reject the change request
D. Evaluate the change request on other project constraints (cost, schedule, and risk, etc.) Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The best thing to do in such scenarios is to analyze the impact on the triple constraints. It is quite possible that the cost and/or the project schedule may increase. At the beginning of all projects, you should require two things regarding change. First, require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure there is no confusion about what is requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change. Second, require that all change requests must go through the formal change control system. Make sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the project manager knowing about them. Furthermore, make certain your stakeholders understand that going around the project manager can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and that it is not good change management practice. From the beginning of the project, encourage the stakeholders to use the formal procedures laid out in the change control system to request changes.

Q128In your project, you implemented a risk response and hired an additional skilled technical worker that can help in testing your application. However, you are worried that the technical worker may leave the project -- this new risk can also be called a:

A. Secondary risk
B. Acceptance risk
C. Change Plan
D. Fallback Plan
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Secondary risks are risks that come about as a result of implementing a risk response. The example given previously where you transferred risk by hiring a driver to take you to your destination but the person became ill along the way is an example of a secondary risk. Illness of the driver delayed your arrival time, which is a risk directly caused by hiring the driver or implementing a risk response. When planning for risk, identify and plan responses for secondary risks. Fallback plans should be developed for risks with high impact or for risks with identified strategies that might not be the most effective at dealing with the risk.
Fallback plans are not contingency plans. For example, in the information technology field, we often have high impact risks associated with upgrading operating systems or implementing new applications. A contingency plan may include calling the vendor to assist in the middle of the night (that is always when things fall apart) when we cannot figure out a solution. A fallback plan in this case may describe how we are going to bring the old system back online so that users can still do their work while we figure out what went wrong with the implementation.

Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The PMBOK Guide-6th Edition, notes that kickoff meetings may occur in two different places in the project, depending on its size. (1)A small project generally involves a small project team who are actively involved in the Planning processes, so it makes sense to hold the kickoff meeting now (in planning process). (2)For large projects, a kickoff meeting is typically held in the Executing process group because the project manager and a few key team members will perform most of the planning before assigning other resources.
(3)lf the project is not mentioned is a large or small project, you must select the planning process as the best answer according to the PMI- PMP Exam content outline, planning domain, task # 12. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 86]

Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Independent estimates are also known as should cost estimates. Independent Estimate is a process of using a third party to obtain and analyze information to support a prediction of cost, schedule, or other items. Option C. Incorrect. The purpose of the bidder conferences is to allow all prospective vendors to meet with the buyers to ask questions and clarify issues they have regarding the project and the RFP. The facilitator of the meeting should ensure that the meeting is orderly and that all questions and answers are restated in front of the entire group; that way, all potential vendors have an equal chance at the bid. The meeting is held once, and all vendors attend at the same time. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 708]

Q137You are the project manager for a construction company that is building a new city and county office building in your city. You have calculated earned value measurements and found that the current CPI is 1.08 and the current SPI is 0.88. You are looking for options to reduce the project schedule. You look at the network diagram and start identifying the sequence of activities which can happen in parallel. Which technique are you using?

A. Decomposition
B. Crashing
C. Resource leveling
D. Fast Tracking
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased risk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical path. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities concerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.
Option (B): Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery to activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources will shorten the duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in increased risk andior cost. Option (A): The Create WBS process consists of two tools and techniques: decomposition and expert judgment. Decomposition involves breaking down the deliverables into smaller, more manageable components of work. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 185, 215]

Since your team members are dispersed across the globe, you have several team members for a position on the project that requires specific qualifications. All the team members seem to meet the qualifications. You also consider their skills, abilities, quantity, and availability of these potential team, which of the following should you use to keep track of the availability of team members?

A. Resource breakdown structure
B. Responsibility assignment matrix
C. Resource calendars
D. Project staff assignments
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The resource calendars describes the time frames in which resources (both human and material) are available. They outline work days, normal business hours, shift-work hours if they apply, and days off such as holidays or non-work days like weekends. They look at a particular resource or groups of resources and their skills, abilities, quantity, and availability. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing resource and the person assigned to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in June. The resource calendar would show vacation schedule of the team. Resource calendars also examine the quantity, capability, and availability of equipment and material resources that have a potential to impact the project schedule. For example, suppose your project calls for a hydraulic drill and your organization owns only one. The resource calendar will tell you whether it is scheduled for another job at the same time it is needed for your project.
For the final exam, Resource calendars show availability of the team the team members and the times they are scheduled to work on the project. A composite resource calendar includes availability information for potential resources as well as their capabilities and skills. The Resource breakdown structure(RBS) lists the resources by category and type. You may have several categories of resources, including labor, hardware, equipment, supplies, and so on. Type describes the types of resources needed, such as skill levels or quality grades of the material and so on. The Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) relates the OBS to the WBS to ensure that every component of the work of the project is assigned to an individual. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 199]

Q155You are working on a software development project using an agile approach. You are managing this project using a visual, pull-based concept so hat work progresses through the steps as resources are available. You want to improve the way that the team builds software, so you get them all to improve collaboratively and evolve experimentally by coming up with changes that they can make to their process together, and by using data to figure out if those changes made things better. Your project teams are focused on flowing work through the system o completion and not beginning new work until work in progress is completed.
Which of the following methods are you using?

A. Crystal Method
B. Kanban Method
C. Scrumban
D. Critical Path Method
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The Kanban Method (Is very important for the exam) may be best used when a team or organization is in need of the following conditions: Flexibility. Teams are typically not bound by timeboxes and will work on he highest priority item in the backlog of work. Focus on continuous delivery. Teams are focused on flowing work hrough the system to completion and not beginning new work until work in progress is completed.
Increased productivity and quality. Productivity and quality are increased by limiting work in progress.
Increased efficiency. Checking each task for value adding or non-value-added activities and removing the non-value adding activities. Team member focus. Limited work in progress allows the team to focus on the current work. Variability in the workload. When there is unpredictability in he way that work arrives, and it becomes impossible for teams to make predictable commitments; even for short periods of ime. Reduction of waste. Transparency makes waste visible so it can be removed. Option (A) Crystal methodologies are designed to scale, and provide a selection of methodology rigor based on project size (number of people involved in the project) and the criticality of the project.Crystal Methodology realizes that each project may require a slightly tailored set of policies, practices, and processes in order to meet the unique characteristics of he project. The family of methodologies use different colors based on (weight) to determine which methodology to use. The use of the word crystal comes from the gemstone where the various faces represent underlying core principles and values. Option (C): Scrumban is an agile approach originally designed as a way to transition from Serum to Kanban. As additional agile frameworks and methodologies emerged, it became an evolving hybrid framework in and of itself where teams use Serum as a framework and Kanban for process improvement.

Q156You are managing a large construction project for a government customer. The project has been progressing well on both schedule and cost standpoints. Due to global events, the customer has requested that you decrease the project duration by two months. The activities will be handled simultaneously instead of sequentially, and no additional resources will be made available to complete the project. Under these new constraints, which of the following techniques will you use to decrease the project duration?

A. Crashing
B. East-tracking
C. Resource leveling
D. Implementing the use of project management software
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Fast tracking is applied by re-scheduling various activities within the project to be worked on simultaneously instead of waiting for each activity to be completed separately. Fast tracking is the best answer in this scenario. resources were the original constraint on this project, so it is unlikely the project manager would get more resources to assist with the project. Option (A) -- Crashing is a schedule compression technique that involves adding resources to activities on the critical path so you can finish faster. Crashing almost always involves a financial cost. This is not the right answer since it involves adding resources. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 21 5]

A. $3,500 loss
B. $3,500 profit
C. $500 loss
D. $500 profit
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Expected monetary value is calculated be EMV = Probability * Impact We need to calculate both positive and negative values and then add to them. (EMV) to profit = +$10,000 * 15% = +$1,500, (EMV) to loss = -$20,000 * 10% = -$2,000. EMV = EMV to profit + EMV to loss EMV = $1,500 + $(-2,000) = -$0.500 = $500 loss.

Q161The project manager and a functional manager cannot reach an agreement about the assignment of resources for a project. The functional manager insists that the resources are not available due to other priorities. In this case, the conflict will require the assistance of the:

A. Customer
B. Project sponsor
C. New project manager
D. Contractor
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Generally, project conflicts should be resolved at the lowest levels of authority whenever possible. In some cases, conflict requires the involvement of the project sponsor or executive, especially when there is an impasse regarding resource assignments. Customers and contractors would not, in most cases, become involved in internal resource management disputes. The project sponsor, generally an executive in the organization with the authority to assign resources and enforce decisions regarding the project, is a stakeholder. The project sponsor generally serves as the tie-breaking decision maker and is one of the people on your escalation path. The project sponsor is also the person who approves the project charter and gives the project manager the authority to commence with the project. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 34]

Q165Measuring the square footage of a building and then multiplying that figure by a set cost factor for construction is an example of:

A. Parametric estimating
B. Analogous estimating
C. Independent estimating
D. Bottom up estimating
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the quantity of work by the rate or uses an algorithm in conjunction with historical data to determine cost, budget, or duration estimates. The best way to describe it is with an example. Suppose you are working on a companywide network upgrade project. This requires you to run new cable to the switches on every floor in the building.
To come up with an estimate, you can use parametric estimates to determine activity duration estimates by taking a known element - in this case, the amount of cable needed - and multiplying it by the amount of time it takes to install a unit of cable. In other words, suppose you have 10,000 meters of new cable to run. You know from past experience it takes 1 hour to install 100 meters. Using this measurement, you can determine an estimate for this activity of 100 hours to run the new cable. Therefore, the cable activity duration estimate is 100 hours.

Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The PMBOK Guide, 6th. Edition, states that you can also use parametric estimating to determine time estimates for the entire project or portions of the project when you are using this technique in conjunction with other estimating techniques. For the exam, remember that a statistical relationship exists between historical data and other variables (as explained in the cable example earlier) when using parametric estimates and that this technique can be highly accurate if the data you are using is reliable.

Q181In your project, you want to reduce the project scope to minimize the risk that your project may not get the resources in time to complete it. What type of risk response strategy is this?

A. Risk avoidance
B. Risk mitigation
C. Risk transference
D. Risk acceptance
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Risk avoidance. To avoid a risk means you will evade it altogether by eliminating the cause of the risk event or by changing the project management plan or reducing the project scope and/or extend project schedule to protect the project objectives from the risk event. Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise. Option A. The acceptance strategy is used when you are not able to eliminate all the threats on the project and/ or you are willing to accept the impacts of the risk. Acceptance of a risk event is a strategy that can be used for risks that pose either threats or opportunities to the project and is generally used for low-impact risk events. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. Option B. According to the PMBOK Guide, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors. Option
E. The idea behind a risk transfer is to transfer the risk and the consequences of that risk to a third party.
The risk has not gone away, but the responsibility for the management of that risk now rests with another party. Some examples of risk mitigation include the use of insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for specified risks to another party (Fixed-Price contract is used to transfer the risk(S) to the seller).

Q187Determining if the project scope has been completed relies mostly on the use of a:

A. Project charter
B. Project scope statement
C. Statement of work
D. Project plan
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Project scope statement. The scope statement answers the questions of what, why, who, where, and how.
In combination with the work breakdown structure, it provides a detailed description of what must be accomplished. The purpose of the project scope statement is to document the project objectives, deliverables, and the work required to produce the deliverables. The scope statement is an agreement between the project management team and the project customer that states precisely what the work of the project will produce. Simply put, the scope statement tells everyone concerned with the project exactly what they are going to get when the work is finished. Since the scope statement serves as a baseline for the project, if questions arise or changes are proposed later in the project, they can be compared to what is documented in the scope statement. Making change decisions is easier when the original deliverables and requirements are well documented. You will also know what is out of scope for the project simply because the work is not documented in the scope statement (or conversely, deliverables or other elements are documented and noted as being specifically out of scope). The criteria outlined in the scope statement will also be used to determine whether the project was completed successfully. Option C. Statement of Work (SOW): is also known as Project Statement of Work (to distinguish with Procurement Statement of Work) is a document including the high-level description of the intended deliverables of the project.

The project is officially authorized when the project charter is signed. Option B. The purpose of a business case is to understand the business need for the project and determine whether the investment in the project is worthwhile. The business case also contains the financial analysis (such as NPV, ROI, IRR, PBP, and BCR), and it describes the business need or demand that brought about the project. As a refresher, these business needs or demands include market demand, organizational need, customer request, technological advance, legal requirements, ecological impacts, and social needs. Option D. Business value. The net quantifiable benefit derived from a business endeavor. The benefit may be tangible, intangible, or both.

The communications management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how project communications will be planned, structured, implemented, and monitored for effectiveness. The plan contains the following information: Stakeholder communication requirements; Information to be communicated, including language, format, content, and level of detail; Escalation processes; Reason for the distribution of that information; Timeframe and frequency for the distribution of required information and receipt of acknowledgment or response, if applicable; Person responsible for communicating the information; Person responsible for authorizing release of confidential information; Person or groups who will receive the information, including information about their needs, requirements,and Expectations; Methods or technologies used to convey the information, such as memos, email, press releases, or social media; Resources allocated for communication activities, including time and budget; Method for updating and refining the communications management plan as the project progresses and develops, o such as when the stakeholder community changes as the project moves through different phases; Glossary of common terminology; Flow charts of the information flow in the project, workflows with possible sequence of authorization, list of o reports, meeting plans, etc.; and Constraints derived from specific legislation or regulation, technology, organizational policies, etc. The communications management plan can include guidelines and templates for project status meetings, project team meetings, e-meetings, and email messages. The use of a project website and project management software can be included if these are to be used in the project. For the PMP Exam, (at least 8 questions related to the communication management plans). There is a subtle difference between the communications management plan and the stakeholder engagement plan in the Executing process group. The communications management plan is used to manage the flow of information to the stakeholders in order to keep them engaged and informed. The stakeholder engagement plan helps maintain relationships with the stakeholders, helps to ensure their support, and manages stakeholder expectations. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 377]

Q199You are constructing a high rise building in New York, and during the implementation phase, you have identified high potential risk to the schedule. You have identified the response strategy for this risk, and you have decided to create a change request to extend the project duration in order to eliminate the negative effects. What type of risk response strategy is this?

A. Risk acceptance
B. Risk mitigation
C. Risk transfer
D. Risk avoidance
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
To avoid a risk means you will evade it altogether by eliminating the cause of the risk event or by changing the project management plan or reducing the project scope and/or extend project schedule to protect the project objectives from the risk event. Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise.
Option A. The acceptance strategy is used when you are not able to eliminate all the threats on the project and/or you are willing to accept the impacts of the risk. Acceptance of a risk event is a strategy that can be used for risks that pose either threats or opportunities to the project and is generally used for low-impact risk events. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. Option B. According to the PMBOK Guide, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors. Option C. The idea behind a risk transfer is to transfer the risk and the consequences of that risk to a third party. The risk has not gone away, but the responsibility for the management of that risk now rests with another party. Some examples of risk mitigation include the use of insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc.
Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for specified risks to another party (Fixed-Price contract is used to transfer the risk(S) to the seller). [PMBOK, Page 443]
