Q33James has been managing a hotel construction project on a busy street. He is in the process of estimating activity durations for building walls, and he calculates the most likely estimate as 15 days. If prefabricated material is used, it would take no more than 12 days to finish the work. The work may be delayed and could take up to 18 days if less experienced construction workers build the walls. What is the expected duration of building walls using the three-point estimate?

A. 12 days
B. 11 days
C. 16 days
D. 15 days
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
If the engineer is correct, the optimistic estimate can be taken as 12 days. The pessimistic estimate is still 18 days and the most likely estimate is 15 days. Using the PERT or the three-point technique, the expected activity duration is calculated using the formula Te = (To + Tm + Tp)/3, where Te is the estimated duration, To is the optimistic duration, Tm is the most likely duration and Tp is the pessimistic duration. Hence, Te = (12 + 15 +18)/3 = 15 days. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 201] [Project Schedule Management]

A. $24,000
B. $36,000
C. $22,500
D. $37,000
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
If the project work is performed at the budgeted rate, the Estimate at Completion can be computed using the formula EAC = AC + (BAC EV). Substituting all these values in the expression, EAC = $15,000 + ($22,000 - $13,000) = $24,000. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 267] [Project Cost Management]

What should you do if you want to allocate more contingency reserves to account for new risks?

A. Perform the reserve analysis to compare the amount of contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining
B. Perform Monte Carlo analysis to compare the amount of contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining
C. Perform the variance and trend analysis to compare planned results to the actual results
D. Perform the quantitative risk analysis to determine the outstanding risks Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Many risks may develop over the course of any project. Project managers must monitor those risks and plan risk responses. The reserve analysis is used as a tool in the Monitor Risks process. This technique is used to compare the amount of contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining throughout the execution of the project. Hence, you must conduct a reserve analysis first to decide on the contingency allowances. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 456] [Project Risk Management]

Q44In a small office construction project, the following activities are scheduled in sequence. i) Digging and pouring footings: five days. ii) Working on the slab and pouring: three days. iii) Framing the floor: five days. iv) Wall framing: four days. v) Roof framing: six days. vi) Insulation and drywall: seven days. vii) Interior doors and trim: three days. viii) Hardware and fixtures: two days. What is the minimum time to complete the project if all activities are on a critical path except activity viii, and activity iii is delayed by one day?

A. 32 days
B. 33 days
C. 34 days
D. 35 days
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
A critical path has a zero total float. This means that any delay in the critical path activity delays the project finish date. In other words, the critical path gives the minimum time required to complete a project. In this case, adding the durations for all critical path activities gives the minimum time required as 33 days. If activity iii is delayed by one day, then the minimum time required to complete the project will also be delayed by one day, so the minimum time becomes 34 days.

Q49Velvet is working for a chemical industry, and her management proposed two different projects to manufacture benzene for commercial use. After doing financial analysis, the financial advisor provided her with the following statistics about the projects: Project 1: 60 percent probability of success with a profit of $500,000 and 20 percent probability of failure with a loss of $200,000. Project 2: 30 percent probability of success with a profit of $300,000 and 30 percent probability of failure with a loss of $400,000. Based on the information above, Velvet should choose:

A. Either project 1 or project 2
B. Neither project 1 nor project 2
C. Project 2
D. Project 1
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Profit or loss from a project = (Expected profit * probability of profit) - (Expected loss * probability of loss).
For Project 1, the profit or loss = (500000*0.6 - 200000*0.2) = 300000 - 40000 = $260,000 profit. For Project 2, the profit or loss = (300000*0.3 - 400000*0.3) = 90000 120000 = ($30,000) = $30,000 loss.
Hence, Velvet should select Project 1, which can yield a profit. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 435] [Project Risk Management]
