Q21A project manager from a buyer organization is invited to lunch by the manager of a seller organization. The project manager's organization does not permit receipt of gifts from vendors. The project manager should:

A. Go out for lunch and refrain from informing his/her managers about the lunch
B. Avoid going out to lunch with anyone from the seller organization
C. Insist on paying for his/her own lunch
D. Permit the manager from the seller organization to pay for his/her lunch since it has a very small value Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The correct action is for the project manager to insist on paying for his or her own lunch. Avoiding going out to lunch with anyone from the seller organization is drastic, as such a lunch may be an opportunity to build relationships and to understand the seller's position on a project better. Going out to lunch and not informing his or her managers about the lunch is unethical. Allowing the seller organization to pay for an inexpensive lunch may be acceptable in certain organizations. For example, some organizations have placed a limit on the value of gifts that may be received by their employees, and permit gifts that do not exceed a certain value (e.g., $50). In such a case, a lunch may be within acceptable limits. However, in the current situation, the buyer organization does not permit its employees to receive any gifts from vendors.
Therefore, this option is not acceptable. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct] [Prof.

Q43Which of the following techniques used in adaptive lifecycles helps in minimizing scope creep?

A. User stories
B. User epics
C. Iterations
D. Time-boxing
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Time-boxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward completion of a goal. Time- boxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essential features first, then other features when time permits. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 182] [Project Framework]

Q44When are risk identification activities performed?

A. During the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process
B. During the Plan Risk Management process
C. During the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process
D. Ongoing throughout the project
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Identify Risks is the process of determining what risks can affect the project. Many different stakeholders usually participate in the Identify Risks process. The process of Identify Risks is iterative because unknown risks can be discovered throughout the life cycle of the project. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 409] [Project Risk Management]

Q45Bill is the project manager of a software project that was originally estimated to be completed in 12 months. Two months into the project, it is discovered that the original estimating assumptions were fundamentally flawed. The Estimate at Completion (EAC) in such a project will be:

A. EAC = AC + Bottom-up ETC
B. EAC = BAC/CPI
C. EAC = AC + [BAC - EV]/CPI
D. EAC = AC + BAC - EV
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The correct response is: EAC = AC + Bottom-up ETC, where AC stands for the Actual Cost and ETC stands for the Estimate to Complete. ETC based on a new estimate must be used because the original assumptions were fundamentally flawed. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 267] [Project Cost Management]

Answer: 



Q46How would you calculate your EAC if the ETC work is performed at the budgeted rate?

A. EAC = BAC/CPI
B. EAC= BAC-EV
C. EAC = AC + BAC - EV
D. EAC=(BAC-EV)*CPI
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
If the remaining project work is expected to be performed at the budgeted rate, then the formula for EAC is AC + (BAC " EV), where AC is the Actual Cost, BAC is the Budget at Completion, and EV is the Earned Value. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 267] [Project Cost Management]

Q47A project consists of multiple phases. Which of the following is a valid statement and applies to each phase of the project?

A. Each phase is generally concluded with a review of the work accomplished but is only closed if the next phase has already started.
B. Each phase of the project is considered complete when the project sponsor signs off on that phase of the project.
C. Each phase of the project is generally concluded with a review of the work accomplished and deliverables to determine acceptance and whether the phase should be considered closed.
D. Each phase is generally concluded with a review of the work accomplished. A phase is never considered complete until the end of the project when the entire project is complete.
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
A project phase is usually concluded with a review of the work accomplished and the deliverables to determine acceptance, whether extra work is still required and to decide whether the phase should be considered closed. The other options are not valid. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 121] [Project Framework]
