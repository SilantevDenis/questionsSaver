The late start (LS) date for an activity can be calculated by adding the free float for the activity to the early start (ES) date. The formula would be LS = Float+ ES. When applied to the formula, the result is as follows:
LS = Float + ES
LS = 3 + 15
LS = 18
Since the first task starts on day 1, the duration can be calculated by subtracting the ES date from the early finish (EF) date and adding 1. The formula would be Duration = EF - ES + 1. When applied to the formula, the result is as follows:
Duration = EF ­ ES + 1
Duration = 19 - 15 + 1
Duration = 5

Q47You are working on a construction project and have been keeping monthly earned value, actual cost, and cost performance index statistics, as listed below:
Month1: EV = $11,000, AC = $15,000, CPI = 0.73
Month2: EV = $57,100, AC = $60,500, CPI = 0.94
Month3: EV = $49,250, AC = $67,000, CPI = 0.73
Month4: EV = $61,800, AC = $49,750, CPI = 1.24
The budget for the project was originally set at $392,000. The project sponsors are worried about the final cost, and have asked for an estimate to completion (ETC). Which option represents the current ETC for this project?

A. -$29,505
B. $199,750
C. $421,505
D. $229 255
Correct Answer: D
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The current ETC is $229,255. For more information on how ETC was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
Calculation Explanation
The ETC is calculated by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the estimate at completion:
ETC = EAC - AC
You can easily calculate the AC by summing up the four monthly costs listed in the example. The result is $15,000 + $60,500 + $67,000 + $49,750 = $192,250.
You must now calculate the EAC. To do this, use the following formula:
EAC = budgeted at completion (BAC) / cumulative cost performance index (CPI) You know the BAC is $392,000. In order to calculate the cumulative CPI, you must divide the cumulative earned
value (EV) by the cumulative AC. The cumulative CPI is $179,150 / $192,250 = 0.93. Therefore, the EAC is $392,000 / 0.93 = $421,505.
Since you now know the EAC and the AC, you can finally calculate the ETC:
ETC = $421,505 - $192,250 = $229,255

Q112You are managing an agriculture project that is researching the possibilities of splicing the water retaining capabilities of a cactus with corn seed. This will allow the seed to grow in dry conditions. The project sponsor will be making 12 monthly payments of $100,000 dollars to fund the project. At the six month mark, the project is deemed to be half a month behind schedule. During this time, the project has been working in the red, and the average money spent per month is $110,000. You have been asked by the sponsor to provide a to-complete performance index (TCPI) based upon the project's estimate at completion (EAC), where the ETC work is projected to follow the current CPI.
Which value do you provide the sponsor with?

A. 0.91
B. 0.46
C. 0.83
D. 1.20
Correct Answer: C
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project's TCPI, based upon the project's EAC, is 0.83. For more information on how TCPI based on the EAC was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
Calculation Explanation
TCPI based on the EAC is calculated using the following formula:
TCPI based on the EAC = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)
In order to determine the result, you first need to calculate a few of the variables. The budgeted at completion (BAC) is calculated by multiplying the monthly payment of $100,000 by 12. This results in a BAC of $1,200,000.
Next, you need to calculate the earned value (EV) using the following formula: Actual % Complete * BAC.
The work is currently 45.83% complete (5.5 / 12 = 0.4583). A value of 5.5 months is used since the project is at the six month mark and is half a month behind schedule. Therefore, the project's EV is 0.4583 * $1,200,000 = $549,960.
You can calculate the actual cost by multiplying the average cost per month by the months of work.
Therefore, the AC is $110,000 * 6 = $660,000.
To calculate the EAC, you must first calculate the cost performance index (CPI) using the following formula:
CPI = EV / AC. This results in $549,960 / $660,000 = 0.83. The formula for EAC is BAC / CPI. This results in an EAC of $1,200,000 / 0.83 = $1,445,783.
You now have all the values required to use in the TCPI formula:
TCPI based on the EAC = ($1,200,000 - $549,960) / ($1,445,783 - $660,000) = 0.827, which rounds up to 0.83.

Q122You are managing a large-scale project for your organization. The project has been underway for several months now. Alter performing some calculations, you have determined that there is an SPI of 0.74 and a CPI of 1.34. Which method would BEST bring the project back on track?

A. Apply lags
B. Modify scope
C. Crashing
D. Fast tracking
Correct Answer: C
Section: Planning
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Crashing entails adding additional resources to scheduled activities in an effort to reduce their durations.
The additional resources typically impose additional costs related to the activity. A schedule performance index (SPI) of less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule. A cost performance index (CPI) of more than one indicates that fewer funds have been spent to date than was planned. Therefore, the best solution for this scenario would be to use schedule crashing since the project is behind schedule and has additional funds available.

Q127You are a procurement specialist preparing a contract for a software development project. Through negotiations, it has been determined that a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract type will be used. The following criteria for the contract have been agreed upon:
Target Project Cost: $200,000
Fee to the Seller: $30,000
Share Ratio. 80% Buyer, 20% Seller
Which final payout is appropriate if the project costs $220,000 to perform the work outlined in the contract?

A. $34,000
B. $214,000
C. $246,000
D. $26,000
Correct Answer: C
Section: Planning
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The formula used to calculate the final payout is Target cost + Fixed fee + Buyer share ratio * (Actual Cost - Target Cost).
If the final costs are $220,000, the Buyer will pay 200,000 + 30,000 + 0.8 * (220,000 - 200,000) = $246,000.
In this scenario, the seller earns $26,000, which is less than if the target cost was not exceeded. $246,000 (final payout) - $220,000 (actual cost) = $26,000 profit. In this case, the incentive is a negative value of -$4,000 that comes off the predetermined fee of $30,000 that was agreed upon.

Correct Answer: A
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The schedule performance index (SPI) is calculated by dividing the earned value (EV) by the planned value (PV), or SPI = EV / PV. For more information on how the SPI was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
Calculation Explanation
SPI is calculated using the following formula:
SPI = EV/PV
Since the example does not provide the EV or the PV, they must first be calculated.
The EV is calculated using the following formula: EV = Actual % Complete * budget at completion (BAC).
First, you calculate the Actual % Complete by dividing 2 by 5. You use 2 because although the planned work is at week three, the actual project work is one week behind. This must be taken into consideration.
This gives an Actual % Complete of 40% (2 / 5 = 0.4). You then multiply this with the BAC to get an EV of 0.4 * $780,000 = $312,000.
Next, you calculate the PV using the following formula: PV = Planned % Complete * BAC. First, you need to calculate the Planned % Complete by dividing the planned point in the schedule (three weeks) by the total number of weeks in the project (five weeks). This will result in 60% (3 / 5 = 0.6). The Planned % Complete is then multiplied with the BAC, which results in a PV of 0.6 * $780,000 = $468,000.
Now that you have the EV and the PV, you can apply them to the original formula to obtain the SPI: SPI = $312,000 / $468,000 = 0.67

Q182You are managing a project that is planning the anniversary celebrations for the city. The preparations have been estimated to take ten weeks. The total cost of the project is set at $205,000. After five weeks, it has been determined that the project is half a week ahead of schedule, and the cost so far is $143,000. Which option represents the schedule variance of this project?

A. -$10,250
B. -$55,000
C. $260,000
D. $10,250
Correct Answer: D
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The schedule variance (SV) is calculated by subtracting the planned value (PV) from the earned value (EV), or SV = EV - PV. For more information on how the SV was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
Calculation Explanation
SV is calculated using the following formula:
SV = EV - PV
Since the example does not provide the EV or the PV, they must first be calculated.
PV is calculated by multiplying the percentage of the project you had planned to have completed at a specific point in time (Planned % Complete) by the budget at completion (BAC). Since the project was projected to last ten weeks and we have completed five weeks, the Planned % Complete at this point is 50% (5 weeks /10 weeks = 0.50 or 50%).
PV = Planned % Complete * BAC = 50% * $205,000 = $102,500
EV is calculated by multiplying the actual percentage of the project that you have completed at a specific point in time (Actual % Complete) by the BAC. Since we know that the project is half a week ahead of our original schedule at five weeks, our Actual % Complete is 55% (5.5 weeks / 10 weeks = 0.55 or 55%).
EV = Actual % Complete * BAC = 55% * $205,000 = $112,750
Now that you have the EV and the PV, you can apply them to the original formula to obtain the SV:
SV = EV - PV = $112,750 - $102,500 = $10,250

A. -$8,950
B. $25,510
C. -$25,510
D. $683,850
Correct Answer: C
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The current projected variance at completion (VAC) for this project is -$25,510. For more information on how VAC was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
Calculation Explanation
VAC is calculated using the following formula:
VAC = BAC - EAC
In this case, you know the BAC ($1,250,000), but you do not know the EAC. The proper way to calculate the EAC in this scenario is by using the following formula: EAC = BAC / cumulative CPI. Therefore, you must first calculate the cumulative CPI.
To calculate the cumulative CPI, you have to add up the earned values (EVs) and you have to add up the actual costs (ACs) for all months up to the point at which you need to calculate the cumulative CPI. The cumulative EV is $57,000 + $187,100 + $149,500 + $161,800 = $555,400. The cumulative AC is $49,000 + $178,500 + $167,900 + $170,750 = $566,150. You then need to divide the cumulative EV by the cumulative AC ($555,400 / $566,150 = 0.98) to get the cumulative CPI of 0.98.
Once you have the cumulative CPI, you can then calculate the EAC. This will work out to an EAC of $1,250,000 / 0.98 = $1,275,510.
Then once the EAC is subtracted from the BAC, you can determine the VAC:
VAC = $1,250,000 - $1,275,510 = -$25,510

Which option represents the cumulative CPI for the end of the three months?

A. 0.99
B. 0.94
C. 1.11
D. 1.01
Correct Answer: A
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
To calculate the cumulative cost performance index (CPI) you have to add up the earned values (EVs) and actual costs (ACs) for all months up to the point at which you need the cumulative CPI.
So in this case, the cumulative EV would be $27,000 + $147,000 + $101, 000 = $275,000 and the cumulative AC would be $19,000 + $151,500 + $106,900 = $277,400.
You would then use the following formula: cumulative CPI = cumulative EV / cumulative AC. This results in a cumulative CPI of $275,000 / $277,400 = 0.99.
