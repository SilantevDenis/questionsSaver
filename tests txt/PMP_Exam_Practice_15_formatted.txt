Q1A government agency has awarded your company a massive software project. This project has an early completion incentive, and your company has a policy of paying a bonus to the project manager if such an incentive is awarded. However, this particular government agency has a reputation for being extremely difficult to work with; there is a great deal of bureaucracy within this agency, and stonewalling and hostility toward contractors are common. The project manager will need to have excellent political skills to lead this project successfully. You have been asked to lead the project because of your expertise with this type of project. However, you have never worked within such a highly charged and political environment. What should you do?

A. Decline the project citing lack of experience.

Q20After conducting a bidder conference, you receive an email from one of the bidders requesting additional information. The information was neither included in your request for proposal, nor did anyone ask for it during the bidder conference. You realize the answer to this question is critical to understanding the scope of the project. If the answer is not communicated to bidders, they cannot size their teams accurately or estimate the total duration of the project. The answer also greatly affects cost. However, the answer contains some proprietary information that, if disclosed to a competitor, may reveal the future product strategy of your company. Such a disclosure could be disastrous for a major product launch you are planning next year. You decide to send the answer to all the bidders, but you realize one of the bidders is also working closely with one of your competitors on a similar project. What should you do?

A. Don't send this information in writing; instead, telephone each bidding company.
B. Send this information to all bidders except the bidder working with your competitor.
C. Send this information to only the supplier who requested it.
D. Require all bidders to sign a nondisclosure agreement. You may then send the information to each company that signed the NDA.
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The best choice is to require all bidders to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before sending them this additional information, and then provide the additional information to each bidder that has signed an NDA.
Project managers are required to act fairly and provide equal access to information to all authorized parties.
Sending the information to only some of the bidding companies would represent a violation of the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q35You are managing a project with a large multinational staff. Susan, one of the engineers, was originally asked to deliver her part of the work on October 19. Due to a change in the critical path, her deliverable will be needed two days sooner. However, as the new deadline is still two weeks away and she is ahead of schedule, you are confident her delivery will be on time. During a staff meeting, you learn from John, her functional manager, that Susan celebrates a religious holiday on October 17. However, he also tells you that Susan is not particularly religious; if pushed a bit and offered some incentive, she may forego celebrating this holiday and come to work. What should you do?

A. Check whether one of her colleagues can share some of her workload this week
B. Increase her project incentive if she agrees to deliver her presentation on the 17th
C. Let the critical path remain the same
D. Ask her boss to ask her to skip the holiday
