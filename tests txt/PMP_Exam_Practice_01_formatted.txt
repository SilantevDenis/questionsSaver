Q16Various tools and techniques determine project requirements during the Collect Requirements process. These requirements form the basis for defining the project scope. One of the responsibilities of a project manager is to identify key project deliverables during this exercise.
Where are the key project deliverables documented?

A. Scope Management Plan
B. Requirements Management Plan
C. Project Scope Statement
D. Accepted Deliverables
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The project scope statement provides the product description, acceptance criteria, key deliverables, project boundaries, assumptions, and constraints about the project. The scope management plan and the requirements management plan are the subsidiary plans of the overall project management plan and they detail how the project team needs to manage the project scope and requirements respectively. These plan do not document the actual scope of the project. Accepted Deliverables is the wrong answer since deliverables are accepted post completion and validation, the identification of the key deliverable is done early during the planning phase of the project.

Q20A business is considering more than a dozen infrastructure upgrade projects. These projects, once delivered, will add to the organization's overall performance but will not contribute to any of the revenue streams. Prior to initiating any such project, the value of the project to the organization must be determined. Which of the following is the most important factor to consider in such a scenario?

A. Net Present Value (NPV) of the projects
B. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the projects
C. Alignment with the strategic goals
D. Investment requirement
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Projects help in achieving organizational goals whey they are aligned with the organization's strategy. If the projects are misaligned with the organizational strategic goals, they are most likely to produce undesirable results either in the short-term or the long-term. NPV and IRR calculations are great measures, however, these are not applicable since these projects will not contribute to any of the revenue streams. Investment requirement is important but is useless on the projects that are not aligned with the strategic goals of the organization.

Q25A contractor is currently constructing a new building for your organization on a cost-plus-incentive contract. You just received the project status report from the contractor's project manager. According to the report, the project's CPI is 1.5. You are shocked because you believe the project costs are out of control. Upon investigation, you learn the $1 million advance payment (20 percent of the estimated project cost) given to the contractor at the start of the project was included in the project's earned value. Further, the cost of the inventory at the project site was excluded from the total actual costs. According to the contract, your company reimburses only the costs for the completed deliverables and not for the supplies in the project's inventory. In this scenario, the reported project's CPI is incorrect because:

A. Actual cost is understated.
B. Earned value is overstated, and actual cost is understated.
C. Earned value is overstated.
D. Both the earned value and the actual cost are overstated.
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
In this scenario the earned value has been overstated while the reported actual cost is ok. Earned value should be the sum of PVs of all completed activities. The initial 20% advance should not be part of this.
Further, since the buyer is not liable for the inventory cost and only reimburses the costs associated with completed deliverables, the cost of the inventory does not become part of the actual cost until that inventory is consumed during the construction process. The inventory is an asset for the contactor until it is consumed on the project and at that time it becomes a cost for the project.

C. Decode -> Encode -> Transmit -> Acknowledge -> Feedback
D. Encode -> Transmit -> Decode -> Feedback -> Acknowledge
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)

Q27Recently, a junior team member has challenged the project management approach since not all requirements identified during the Collect Requirements process were documented in the project scope statement. You are the project manager, what should you do first?

A. Remove the junior team member from the team as this is a disciplinary issue.
B. Analyze the objection and determine if the requirements were deliberately dropped during the Define Scope process.
C. Engage the project sponsor to resolve the issue.
D. Accept your mistake and include the missed requirements.
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
All the requirements identified in Collect Requirements may not be included in the project as the Define Scope process selects the final project requirements from the requirements documentation developed during the Collect Requirement process. Analyzing the objection and determining if the requirements were deliberately dropped during the Define Scope process is the best response. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 151] [Project Risk Management]

A. Select the high-budget projects and drop the low-budget projects
B. Select the low-budget projects and drop the high-budget projects
C. Select the projects that maximize organizational revenue
D. Select the projects that maximize the business value
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Project should never be prioritized based on their budgets. Selecting the projects that maximize organizational revenue or selecting the projects that maximize the business value seem good options.
However, adding to business value takes precedence over adding the organizational revenue, since there can be projects that add more to the revenue but add less to the business value. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 7] [Project Integration Management]

Q30Increasing the number of resources in order to crash a project schedule does not always cut the time by the same factor. In worst cases, too many resources assigned to an activity may actually increase the activity duration. This is because:

A. Decrease in cost budget
B. Required additional coordination
C. Funding limit reconciliation
D. Additional risk introduced due to crashing
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Increasing the number of resources in order to crash a project schedule does not always cut the time by the same factor.

D. Stage gate
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Stage Gates, Phase Gates and Kill Points all refer to a phase end review with the objective of obtaining authorization to close the current phase and start the next one. This is a retrospective review of the current phase. Phase planning, on the other hand, is performed early during the planning phase of the project.

Q46Kevin is assigned to a software development project that will start in the near future and is currently tailoring the PMBOK processes to satisfy the project's specific needs. Kevin wants to introduce a new process, "Identify Key Deliverables", to the existing six project scope management processes. Although he understands that project deliverables identification is already in the PMBOK scope management processes, he believes that having a dedicated process will stress the importance of determining and agreeing to key project deliverables. The best position for the new "Identify Key Deliverables" process should be between which of the following two processes?

A. Define Scope and Create WBS
B. Create WBS and Validate Scope
C. Plan Scope Management and Collect Requirements
D. Collect Requirements and Define Scope
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The identification of key project deliverables can only be done once the project requirements are collected, analyzed and documented. This is done during the Collect Requirements process. Further, the key project deliverables are documented in the project scope statement which is an output of the Define Scope process. The best position of the newly proposed "Identify Key Deliverables" process should be between the Collect Requirement and Define Scope processes.
