Q1To assist with the selection of a supplier for a large procurement on your project, you have hired a consultant. The consultant has prepared an independent estimate to be used as a benchmark while reviewing bids on the RFP. The independent estimate is confidential and is not shared with any bidders. When the sealed bids are opened, you discover that only one supplier has submitted a quote lower than the independent estimate. All other quotes are 45 percent to 70 percent higher than the benchmark. While discussing this development with members of the project team, you learn a distant relative of the consultant owns the company with the lowest bids. What is the best course of action?

A. Confirm the lowest bidder has understood the requirements and award them the contract
B. Since one of the suppliers knows more than others, you must disclose the independent estimate to all others to be fair
C. Disqualify the lowest bidder
D. Review the RFP specifications and requirements
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Review the RFP requirements and specifications. Such a wide range of quotes indicates that there may be elements that are not stated clearly or correctly. Because there is no evidence of collusion between the consultant and the lowest bidder, the RFP review is the best choice. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q5Julia is managing a complex industrial process reengineering project. She has identified all her key project stakeholders and has conducted individual interviews with them to identify other project stakeholders, as well. However, Julia is still not satisfied with her project's stakeholders list; she believes there may be more key external stakeholders missing from the list. What can help Julia in this situation?

A. Use stakeholder register templates from the organizational process assets
B. Conduct more meetings with the key stakeholders
C. Get over her fear and finalize the project stakeholder register
D. Seek expert judgment from subject matter experts
Correct Answer: D

Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The stakeholder register template does not contain stakeholders information; it only helps the project manager produce the project's stakeholder register. If Julia is not satisfied with the list, she needs to identify more stakeholders until she is satisfied. Interviewing the identified key stakeholders again might not resolve the issue. The best option is to seek an expert's opinion. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 511] [Project Stakeholder Management]

A. Using enterprise environmental factors in closing the project
B. Using expert judgment in closing the project
C. Using organizational process assets in closing the project
D. Poor project management practice
Correct Answer: B

To schedule such activities, which of the following should she use to keep track of the availability of team members?

A. Project charter
B. Resource calendars
C. Responsibility assignment matrix
D. Project staff assignments
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

The project charter does not supply any of that information.
Hence, Lesley must use resource calendars to know that information. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 323] [Project Resource Management]

A. Escalate this issue to the sponsor and submit all drug testing reports
B. Reject all poor quality drugs and penalize the contractor
C. Convene a meeting with stakeholders and communicate the findings
D. Carry out audits and inspections to verify compliance in the seller's deliverables Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Since the drug testing raised doubts over the chemicals supplied by the contractor, you must ensure that the contractor is satisfying quality requirements by inspecting and auditing the seller's deliverables. Auditing can also include seller's personnel. All other actions, including meeting with the sponsor and stakeholders, can be performed later if the seller is not meeting contractual requirements. Therefore, your first action should be to perform audits and inspections to verify compliance of the seller's deliverables. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 498] [Project Procurement Management]

D. Allocating more resources needs stakeholders approval
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
To meet schedule constraints, schedule compression techniques are used to reduce the schedule's duration. Crashing and fast tracking are two such techniques. Crashing involves allocation of more resources to reduce the duration. Crashing always does not produce a desirable result and may result in increased risk. Providing training is not a problem from the project manager's point of view. Stakeholders' approval is not required when resources are not allocated. Therefore, Mary's concern is only about increased risk or cost due to allocation of more resources to the task. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 215] [Project Schedule Management]

Q41You are managing a heavy equipment manufacturing project that involves many mechanical, electrical, and IT staff. Your team prepared a schedule network diagram using duration estimates with dependencies and constraints. Your team also calculated the critical path for the project using late and early values. Today, your project office has indicated to you that some of the resources you had planned for the project will be unavailable. To deal with this, you explore the possibility of modifying the schedule to account for limited resources. What is your best possible step in such a situation?

A. Recalculate critical path after applying the resource constraints
B. Perform Resource Leveling to account for limited resources
C. Use crashing or fast tracking to level resources across the project
D. Apply leads and lags to develop a viable schedule
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The critical path method is used to prepare a schedule network diagram. A network diagram is prepared initially, and the critical path is then calculated. Availability of resources is entered, and a resourcelimited schedule is prepared. Hence, recalculating the critical path using the critical path method after applying the resource constraints is the next best step. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 210] [Project Schedule Management]

Q47You just completed the first phase of a multi-phase project. You have calculated earned value measurements and found that the current CPI is 0.79 and the current SPI is 0.98. Your next phase plan should focus first on which element of the project:

A. Quality
B. Resources
C. Schedule
D. Cost
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
A Schedule Performance Index (SPI) of less than one indicates that less work has completed than planned, and a Cost Performance Index (CPI) of less than one indicates a cost overrun for the work completed. In this scenario, the cost overrun is more severe than the schedule delay. Therefore, you should focus on reducing the cost of the project. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 263] [Project Cost Management]
