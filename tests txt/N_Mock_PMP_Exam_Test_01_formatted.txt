A. 0.67
B. 0.8
C. 1.2
D. 1.5
Correct Answer: A
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The schedule performance index (SPI) is calculated by dividing the earned value (EV) by the planned value (PV), or SPI = EV/PV. For more information on how the SPI was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
SPI is calculated using the following formula:
SPI = EV/PV
Since the example does not provide the EV or the PV, they must first be calculated.
The EV is calculated using the following formula: EV = Actual % Complete * budget at completion (BAC).
First, you calculate the Actual % Complete by dividing 2 by 5. You use 2 because although the planned work is at week three, the actual project work is one week behind. This must be taken into consideration.
This gives an Actual % Complete of 40% (2 / 5 = 0 4). You then multiply this with the BAC to get an EV of 0.4 * $780,000 = $312,000.
Next, you calculate the PV using the following formula: PV = Planned % Complete * BAC. First, you need to calculate the Planned % Complete by dividing the planned
point in the schedule (three weeks) by the total number of weeks in the project (five weeks). This will result in 60% (3/5 = 0.6). The Planned % Complete is then multiplied with the BAC, which results in a PV of 0.6 * $780,000 = $468,000.
Now that you have the EV and the PV, you can apply them to the original formula to obtain the SPI:
SPI = $312,000/$468,000 = 0.67

Month2: EV = $187,100, AC = $178,500, CPI = 1.04
Month3: EV = $149,500, AC = $167,900, CPI = 0.89
Month4: EV = $161,800, AC = $170,750, CPI = 0.94
The budget for the project was originally set at $1,250,000 for an eight month duration. The project sponsors are worried about the final cost. Which option represents the current projected variance at completion for this roject?

A. $683,850
B. -$25 510
C. $25,510
D. -$8,950
Correct Answer: B
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The current projected variance at completion (VAC) for this project is -$25,510. For more information on how VAC was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
VAC is calculated using the following formula:
VAC = BAC - EAC
In this case, you know the BAC ($1,250,000), but you do not know the EAC. The proper way to calculate the EAC in this scenario is by using the following formula:
EAC = BAC / cumulative CPI.
Therefore, you must first calculate the cumulative CPI.
To calculate the cumulative CPI, you have to add up the earned values (EVs) and you have to add up the actual costs (ACs) for all months up to the point at which you need to calculate the cumulative CPI. The cumulative EV is $57,000 + $187,100 + $149,500 + $161,800 = $555,400. The cumulative AC is $49,000 + $178,500 + $167,900 + $170,750 = $566,150. You then need to divide the cumulative EV by the cumulative AC ($555,400 / $566,150 = 0.98) to get the cumulative CPI of 0.98.
Once you have the cumulative CPI, you can then calculate the EAC. This will work out to an EAC of $1,250,000 / 0.98 = $1,275,510.
Then once the EAC is subtracted from the BAC, you can determine the VAC:
VAC = $1,250,000 - $1,275,510 = -$25,510

A. Definitive estimate
B. Three-point estimate
C. Parametric estimating
D. Analogous estimate
Correct Answer: B
Section: Planning
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The three-point estimate technique aims to improve the accuracy of the activity cost by taking into account the amount of risk in the original estimate. It does this by calculating the best case, worst case, and most likely durations for an activity. When determining a three-point estimate, you first assign weights to the costs and calculate the denominator. A three-point estimate typically assigns a weight of 1 to the optimistic and pessimistic estimates and a weight of 4 to the most likely estimate. The denominator of 6 is the sum of the weightings.

Q39You are working on a construction project and have been keeping monthly earned value, actual cost, and cost performance index statistics, as listed below:
Month1: EV = $11,000, AC = $15,000, CPI = 0.73
Month2: EV = $57,100, AC = $60,500, CPI = 0.94
Month3: EV = $49,250, AC = $67,000, CPI = 0.73
Month4: EV = $61,800, AC = $49,750, CPI = 1.24
The budget for the project was originally set at $392,000. The project sponsors are worried about the final cost, and have asked for an estimate to completion (ETC). Which option represents the current ETC for this project?

A. $229 255
B. $199,750
C. -$29,505
D. $421,505
Correct Answer: A
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The current ETC is $229,255. For more information on how ETC was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
The ETC is calculated by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the estimate at completion:
ETC = EAC - AC
You can easily calculate the AC by summing up the four monthly costs listed in the example. The result is $15,000 + $60,500 + $67,000 + $49,750 = $192,250.
You must now calculate the EAC. To do this, use the following formula:
EAC = budgeted at completion (BAC) / cumulative cost performance index (CPI) You know the BAC is $392,000. In order to calculate the cumulative CPI, you must divide the cumulative earned value (EV) by the cumulative AC. The cumulative CPI is $179,150 / $192,250 = 0.93. Therefore, the EAC is $392,000 / 0.93 = $421,505.
Since you now know the EAC and the AC, you can finally calculate the ETC:
ETC = $421,505 - $192,250 = $229,255

In this scenario, there are no laws preventing you from accepting the gift. It is clearly not a bribe, and the behavior is not unethical based on the country's customs. However, the scenario does state that it is against your company's policy to accept gifts. Therefore, the policy must be followed.

A. Share
B. Accept
C. Transference
D. Enhance
Correct Answer: B

Q122You are managing a project that is overseeing the installation of a golf simulator at the local golf club. The project has been scheduled to take eight weeks. The total cost of the project is set at $78,000. At the five week mark of the project, it has been determined that the project is 1.5 weeks behind schedule, and the cost so far is $45,000. Which option represents the cost variance of this project?

A. -$10,875
B. -$14,625
C. $10,875
D. $3,750
Correct Answer: A
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The cost variance (CV) is the difference in what was expected to be spent and what was actually spent. To calculate the CV, the earned value (EV) must first be calculated. This is done by using the formula EV = Actual % Complete * budget at completion (BAC). First, you calculate the Actual % Complete by dividing 3.5 by 8 (3.5/8 = 0.4375). You do this because the project is at the five week mark, and it is 1.5 weeks behind schedule (5-1.5 = 3.5). This gives an Actual % Complete of 43.75%. You then multiply this by the BAC ($78,000), to get an EV of $34,125 (0.4375 * $78,000 = $34,125). The CV is then calculated by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the EV:
CV = EV - AC
So in this case, CV = $34,125 - $45,000 = -$10,875. The AC is calculated simply by adding up all the money spent so far in the project, which in this scenario is $45,000.

Q164You are managing an agriculture project that is researching the possibilities of splicing the water retaining capabilities of a cactus with corn seed. This will allow the seed to grow in dry conditions. The project sponsor will be making 12 monthly payments of $100,000 dollars to fund the project. At the six month mark, the project is deemed to be half a month behind schedule. During this time, the project has been working in the red, and the average money spent per month is $110,000. You have been asked by the sponsor to provide a to-complete performance index (TCPI) based upon the project's estimate at completion (EAC), where the ETC work is projected to follow the current CPI.
Which value do you provide the sponsor with?

A. 0.91
B. 1.20
C. 0.83
D. 0.46
Correct Answer: C
Section: Monitoring and Controlling
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project's TCPI, based upon the project's EAC, is 0.83. For more information on how TCPI based on the EAC was calculated for this example, please refer to the calculation explanation.
TCPI based on the EAC is calculated using the following formula:
TCPI based on the EAC = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)
In order to determine the result, you first need to calculate a few of the variables. The budgeted at completion (BAC) is calculated by multiplying the monthly payment of $100,000 by 12. This results in a BAC of $1,200,000.
Next, you need to calculate the earned value (EV) using the following formula: Actual % Complete * BAC.
The work is currently 45.83% complete (5.5 /12 = 0.4583). A value of 5.5 months is used since the project is at the six month mark and is half a month behind schedule. Therefore, the project's EV is 0.4583 * $1,200,000 = $549,960.
You can calculate the actual cost by multiplying the average cost per month by the months of work.
Therefore, the AC is $110,000 * 6 = $660,000.
To calculate the EAC, you must first calculate the cost performance index (CPI) using the following formula:
CPI = EV /AC. This results in $549,960 / $660,000 = 0.83.
The formula for EAC is BAC / CPI. This results in an EAC of $1,200,000 / 0.83 = $1,445,783.
You now have all the values required to use in the TCPI formula:
TCPI based on the EAC = ($1,200,000 - $549,960) / ($1,445,783 - $660,000) = 0.827, which rounds up to 0.83.
