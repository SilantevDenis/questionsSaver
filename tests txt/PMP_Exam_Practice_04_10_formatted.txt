Q3After one year of construction, an office building is scheduled for completion on 30 January. The landscaping work needs to start 15 days prior to the building's completion. Which of the following relationships most likely represents the relationship of the start of landscaping work to the completion of the office building?

A. Finish-to-start with a 15-day lead
B. Start-to-finish with a 15-day lead
C. Finish-to-start with a 15-day lag
D. Start-to-finish with a 15-day lag
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The landscaping work needs to start before completion of the office building, so it is a finish-to-start relationship. Since it needs to start 15 days before completion of the building, it requires a lead of 15 days.
Hence, the answer is finish-to-start with a 15-day lead. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 192] [Project Schedule Management]

Q4You are the project manager of a project. As part of the planning process, you use a planning technique to subdivide the project scope and deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. What is this technique called?

A. Unit task analysis
B. Decomposition
C. Rolling wave planning
D. Arrow Diagramming Method
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Decomposition is the process of subdividing the project scope and deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 158] [Project Schedule Management]

Q5The accuracy of Activity Duration estimates can be improved by considering the amount of risk in the original estimate. The three types of estimates on which three-point estimates are based are:

A. Budgetary, ballpark, and Order of Magnitude
B. Best case scenario, expected scenario, and current scenario
C. Most likely, likely, and unlikely
D. Most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The accuracy of Activity Duration estimates can be improved by considering the amount of risk in the original estimate. The three types of estimates on which three-point estimates are based are: Most likely, Optimistic, and Pessimistic. An Activity Duration can be estimated using values derived from these three estimated durations. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 201] [Project Schedule Management]

Answer: 



Q6You have decided to apply Resource Leveling to a project because of a critically required resource being available only at certain times. Which of the following will likely be true?

A. Resource Leveling can often cause the original critical path to change.
B. Resource Leveling will over-allocate resources to schedule the project before the deadline.
C. Resource Leveling will require additional resources to complete the project.
D. Resource Leveling will never alter the original critical path.
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Resource levelling can often cause the original critical path to change. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 211] [Project Schedule Management]

Answer:

Q8A technique that iterates the project schedule many times to calculate a distribution of possible project completion dates is:

A. Monte Carlo Analysis
B. Montford analysis
C. Pareto Cost chart
D. Deming Analysis
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Monte Carlo Analysis is a technique that computes or iterates the project cost or the project schedule many times, using input values selected at random from probability distributions of possible costs or durations. In this way, one can calculate a distribution of possible total project costs or completion dates. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 213] [Project Schedule Management]

Answer: 



Q9The critical path method (CPM) calculates the theoretical early start and finish dates and late start and finish dates. The difference between the late and early start of a task is a:

A. Free float
B. Feeding buffer
C. Danger zone
D. Total float
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The difference between the early and late finish of a task is called the total float for that task. Total float is the amount of time that a scheduled activity can be delayed from its early start date without delaying the project finish date.

Q10You are managing a project that involves work on a film shoot. The editing activity can happen only after the film is shot. The best description of the logical relationship between the editing and shooting of the film is:

A. Finish-to-Finish (FF)
B. Start-to-Start (SS)
C. Start-to-Finish (SF)
D. Finish-to-Start (FS)
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
This is a situation where the editing activity can happen only after the film shooting has been completed.
Hence, the logical relationshipbetween the two tasks is Finish-to-Start (FS). [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 190] [Project Schedule Management]
