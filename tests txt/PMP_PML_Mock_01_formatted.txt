Q1You are a project manager of an external project for a customer. The project is expected to take about a year to complete. Six months into the project, the customer informs you that the project will be terminated. During which of the following processes would procedures be developed to handle early termination of a project?

A. Control Scope
B. Close Project or Phase
C. Define Scope
D. Close Procurements
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
In this scenario the decision of termination is final since the customer informs you that the project will be terminated, you should not proceed with the Close Project or Phase process unless the project has been terminated. The Close Project or Phase process establishes the procedures to investigate and document the reasons for actions taken if a project is terminated before completion. Projects may be terminated for any number of reasons. Examples include: The objectives have been met, the objectives cannot be met, funding is no longer available or was spent, the project is no longer needed, or it was terminated for legal cause or convenience.

Q2A project manager has just closed the design phase for an engine development project and is scheduled to perform a phase gate with the steering committee facilitated by the Project Management Office (PMO).
What is the purpose of performing the phase gate?

A. The performance is compared to the project management plan to determine if the project should be changed, terminated, or continue as planned
B. In order to define, maintain, and manage the scope of the project
C. In order to receive continued support and manage expectations
D. Obtain final acceptance of the project deliverables from relevant stakeholders in order to confirm that project phase and deliverables were achieved
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
At the phase gate, the project charter and busines, documents are reexamined based on the current environment. At that time, performance of the project is compared to the project management plan to determine if the project should be changed, terminated, or continue as planned. The PMBOK Guide states that phase reviews are also known by a few other names: phase gate, phase entrance, phase exit, stage gate and kill points. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition Page 547]

Q3You are developing the Project Charter for a freeway construction project. The project is completed for an external customer. What input do you most likely need to perform the Develop Project Charter process?

A. Project statement of work (SOW)
B. Scope Management Plan
C. Project Management Plan
D. Assumption log
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Although the Project statement of work (SOW) is not mentioned as part of the project charter input in the PMBOK Guide, but you should consider the Project statement of work (SOW) is an input when working through this process for the exam! The Project statement of work, Statement of Work, or SOW, is the bible for the work the project must produce. The SOW is a key governance tool whether it is being used to direct work for a vendor or contractor, or it is being used to direct the work internally, the SOW must contain a description of all the work that is expected. The description need not be at the detail level, indeed for large projects capturing detail in the SOW is not practical, but should be comprehensive and include work that produces the projects deliverables as well as administrative work such as project reporting. The SOW should be written after your Scope Statement, during the planning phase of your project. Your next step will be to have your project sponsors, or the customer for the project, approve the SOW. The SOW will now become the official scope baseline for your project. Anything detailed in the SOW must be present in the final product. Your SOW captures the work the project team will do, but at a high level of detail at the point of creating the project charter. You will need to break these items down further in order to complete your Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). You may find that uniquely identifying each item in your SOW will help you ensure that all the deliverables and work packages described in your SOW are represented in your WBS. You should also check your SOW against the Scope Statement to ensure that all the items in the Scope Statement are represented in the SOW.

Q4A Project Manager is developing the Project Charter for a New York City bus terminal project. The project is executed for an external customer. Which of the following is a valid input that a project manager can use to perform the Develop Project Charter process?

A. Scope Management Plan
B. Letter of intent
C. Project Management Plan
D. Assumption log
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Letter of intent is part of agreement. Agreements are input into the develop project charter process. The major components in an agreement document will vary and may include; Agreements may take the form of contracts, letters of intent, and memorandums of understanding (MOUs), service level agreements (SLA), and letters of agreement, verbal agreements, email, or statement of work (SOW). Typically, a contract is used when a project is being performed for an external customer. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 78]

Q5You are managing a highly complex drug manufacturing project. During the Sequence Activities process, you are using a modeling and analysis technique that allows probabilistic branches (e.g. failure or success), feedback loops, and multiple node realization (repeat events). What is this technique called?

A. Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
B. Critical Path Method (CPM)
C. Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT)
D. Critical Chain Method (CCM)
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT). (However, GERT not mentioned in the PMBOK Guide, 6th. Edition. But you must know this technique for the PMP Exam!). A more flexible generalized network tool which has received increased attention recently is GERT (Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique), GERT includes features such as probabilistic branching (stochastic models), network looping (feedback loops), multiple sink nodes (multiple outcomes), and multiple node realization (repeat events) which are unavailable in PERT/CPM. These GERT features provide the user with the capability to model and analyze projects and systems of a very general form. Since many real-world system problems do involve probabilistic occurrences, false-starts, activity repetition, and multiple outcomes, GERT is an ideal tool for the modeling and analysis.
Option A. And Option B. PERT/CPM networks consist of two major components, activities and events.
Network activities represent actual operations of the real-world project, while events represent milestones in the project that occur at a point in time. Events can represent the beginning or end of an activity or both; and, the beginning or end of both of more than one activity. Activities generally consume time and resources. In network configuration, events are represented by arrows. PERT and CPM differ in that in CPM activities are assumed to have only a single time for duration while in PERT. Reference: https://www.

Q6You are a project manager working on a software development project. During the execution of the project, some disputes arose over the quality of the work. During your project meeting, a problem was discussed with one of the key stakeholders, and a resolution to the problem was reached. However, after two weeks, the key stakeholders came to you and told you that the problem has occurred again. What could have been done differently to prevent this problem from occurring again?

A. Nothing, it is normal in all projects for a problem to happen again and again
B. A fishbone diagram should be performed
C. The key Stakeholder should be engaged early with the problem
D. Quantitative Risk Analysis should be performed
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Cause-and-effect diagrams (also known as fishbone diagrams) show the relationship between the effects of problems and their causes and help identify the root cause of the problem. It is not enough to just find the problem and solve it, you need to trace it back to the thing that caused it. Sometimes you will end up asking Why? again and again until you finally identify a cause of multiple problems, which you can then fix with more impact than if you would just fixed the initial problem. When all root causes for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 292]

Q7Your project progressed as planned until yesterday. Suddenly, an unexpected risk event occurred. You quickly devised a response to deal with this negative risk event using which of the following outputs of Monitor Risk Process?

A. Workaround plans
B. Risk management plan updates
C. Workarounds
D. Corrective action
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Workarounds are unplanned responses. They deal with negative risk events as they occur. As the name implies, workarounds were not previously known to the project team. The risk event was unplanned, so no contingency plan existed to deal with the risk event, and thus it required a workaround. a workaround is not mentioned in the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, but this is an important concept you may need to know for the exam.

B. Stakeholders analysis
C. Developing the project management plan
D. Developing the project charter
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Project objectives, success criteria, key deliverables, high-level requirements, summary milestones, and other summary information elements contained in the project charter. For this process (developing he project charter), meetings are held with key stakeholders to identify the project objectives, success criteria, key deliverables, high-level requirements, summary milestones, and other summary information.

Q9You work for a Car manufacturer. Your project is going to design and produce a new car. The design team is involved in comparing actual or planned project practices or the quality standards to those of comparable projects to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. This is an example of which of the following tools and techniques of plan quality management?

A. Benchmarking
B. Quality metrics
C. Cost of quality (COQ)
D. Design of experiments (DOE)
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Benchmarking. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned project practices or quality standards to those of comparable projects to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. Benchmarked projects may exist within the performing organization or outside of it or can be within the same application area or other application area. Benchmarking allows for analogies from projects in a different application area or different industries to be made. Option C. Cost of quality (COQ) is defined as a methodology that allows an organization to determine the extent to which its resources are used for activities that prevent poor quality, that appraise the quality of the organizational products or services, and that result from internal and external failures. Option D. Design of experiments (DOE) is not a named tool and technique of this process, but you should know this technique for the exam.
DOE is a statistical technique that identifies the elements- or variables -- that will have the greatest effect on overall project outcomes. It is used most often concerning the product of the project but can also be applied to project management processes to examine trade-offs. DOE designs and sets up experiments to determine the ideal solution for a problem using a limited number of sample cases. It analyzes several variables at once, allowing you to change all (or some of) the variables at the same time and determine which combination will produce the best result at a reasonable cost.

Q10You are managing a complex industrial construction project, and the project stakeholders have suggested many changes to the project scope. Change requests have been implemented by the project team during the Direct and Manage Project Work process without documenting them. Because of these changes, the project was delayed, causing cost overruns at the end of the project. As a project manager, what could have been done differently to prevent your project from cost overrun?

A. Change management plan
B. Project management plan
C. Control charts
D. Scope management plan
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
You should require two things regarding change management plan for all projects. First, require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure there is no confusion about what is requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate the time and/or cost it will take to incorporate the change. Second, require that all change requests go through the formal change control system. Make sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the project manager knowing about them. Also make certain your stakeholders understand that going around the project manager can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and that it is not good change management practice. From the beginning of the project, encourage the stakeholders to use the formal procedures laid out in the change control system to request changes. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 170]

Q11Your project charter has been approved, and now you are working on your project management plan. You know a best practice is to have a kick-off meeting. At the end of the project kick-off meeting, what is the next process?

A. Initiating
B. Planning
C. Executing
D. Closing
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The PMBOK Guide notes that kickoff meetings may occur in two different places in the project, depending on its size (small projects in planning-large projects in executing phase). But if not mentioned the size of the project the answer will be at the end of the planning and before starting the executing phase.

Q12You are the project manager for your organization and you are dealing with several risks about the materials used in the project. You are using a simulation analysis technique, and in a simulation, the project model is computed many times (hundreds or thousands of iterations), with the input values (e.g. cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each iteration from the probability distributions of these variables. Which technique can help you to accomplish this goal?

A. Decision-tree analysis
B. Sensitivity analysis
C. Influence diagram
D. Monte Carlo analysis
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed uncertainties of the project into their potential impact on project objectives. Iterative simulations are typically performed using the Monte Carlo Analysis technique. In this technique, the project model is computed many times with the input values chosen at random for each iteration from the probability distributions of these variables. A probability distribution (e.g. total cost or completion date) is calculated from these iterations.

Q13You are a project manager for a manufacturing company. You are creating a project schedule for your project. Your project entails manufacturing a new car to an important customer, and your primary constraint is a deadline of May 25. Reverse resource allocation scheduling is used when specific resources are needed at certain times. Which of the following tools and techniques will you use to help resolve this problem?

A. Resource leveling
B. Reverse resource allocation
C. Critical chain method
D. Resource smoothing
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Resource smoothing adjusts the schedule activities within their floats and does not impact the project end date. This question states that your deadline for the project is May 25, implying you cannot change the end date. The critical chain method adds activity buffers, which can change the project end date. Resource smoothing modifies activities within their floats without changing the critical path or project end date. It is used when changes to the critical path cannot or should not be made. Reverse resource allocation scheduling is used when specific resources are needed at certain times. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 211]

Q14You are a project manager working on a project when the customer wants another feature added to the product. However, there is no additional budget for the new feature. As a project manager, what should you do next?

A. Ask your manager for guidance
B. Follow the contract change control process
C. Remove some other feature and add the new feature
D. Negotiate with the customer to provide additional funding for the new feature Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The right process is to follow change control. In this case, the customer is asking for a change, so follow the change control process. It is quite possible that you can remove the old feature and add the new feature at the same cost, but it should be done following the change control process. Option (A) Ask your manager for guidance: It is a responsibility of the P.M. to look for options to solve any problems related to the project before asking for guidance. Option (C) Remove some other feature and add the new feature. As a project manager, you cannot add or remove the new feature without following the change control process. Option (D) You should inform the customer about the new feature but cannot ask for additional funding, because the sponsor always provides funding.

Q15While reviewing the performance reports of your project, you notice that the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is 0.93 and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is 0.73.
In this case you should:

A. Make changes to the performance baseline to improve the SPI
B. Evaluate options to crash the project
C. Evaluate options to fast-track the project
D. Inform the management why the project got delayed
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Evaluate
options to fast-track the project. SPI = 0.73 < 1 (behind schedule). When you see an SPI that is lower than 1, that means your project is behind schedule, so you need to evaluate options to fast tracking or crashing to get the project back on track.
A cost performance index (CPI) that is 0.93 < 1 indicates that the project is over budget. This means that crashing the schedule, which is typically a costly activity, is not an option, so will eliminate option C.
Option A. make changes the performance and informing the management why the project got delayed essentially delaying the situation. Instead, the project manager should try to prevent the situation by evaluating options to get the project back on track. [PMBOK Guide - Sixth Edition, Page 267]

Q16After several months of negotiations, your organization is almost ready to sign a contract. The contract will span multiple years and allow for final price adjustments based on changing conditions. The ideal contract type is:

A. Firm fixed price
B. Fixed price incentive fee
C. Fixed price with economic price adjustment
D. Time and materials
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Fixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA). This type is used whenever performance of the seller period spans a considerable period of years, or if the payments are made in a different currency. It is a fixed-price contract, but with a special provision allowing for predefined final adjustments to the contract price due to changed conditions, such as inflation changes or cost increases (or decreases) for specific commodities.

A. Follow the change management plan
B. Follow the project management plan
C. Follow the requirement management plan
D. Follow the quality management plan
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The quality management plan defines the standards, tools, responsibilities, and activities needed to achieve the quality goals. It also specifies the quality activities and roles needed to carry them out. The quality management plan is important because it shows how the quality will be managed, controlled and executed, and how the changes to standards, process, and procedures of quality will be handled and documented.

B. Pass the change request through the Integrated Change Control process
C. Accept the change request
D. Implement the change request and communicate with the customer Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The first step in processing any change request is to fully analyze and understand its impact on the project.
It is quite possible that the cost andior the project schedule may increase. At the beginning of all projects, you should require two things regarding change. First, require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure there is no confusion about what is requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change. Second, require that all change requests must go through the formal change control system (Option B).

A. Start-A-B-D-F
B. Start-A-C-E-F
C. Start-A-B-D-F, and Start-A-C-E-F
D. Start-A-B-D-E-F
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The two paths you have in this question are Start-A-B-D-F, and Start-A-C-E-F. Path Start-A-B-D-F would take 0 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 days, or 14 days to complete. Path Start-A-B-D-F would take 0 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 days, or 15 days to complete.
Carefully draw the network diagram, list all the possible paths, and then determine the duration of each path. The critical path(s) is the longest path of tasks in the project.

Q23You are building a suspension bridge for a state government. Your organization is considered a specialist in executing the suspension bridges and overall management of construction activities. However, your organization lacks resources to design the steel-works involved. You have hired design engineers to design the steel-works. A design engineer will work with you for six months and with a monthly salary of US $7,000. Which of the following contract types will you use to get the design engineers?

A. Cost-reimbursable contract
B. Time and materials contract
C. Fixed-price contract
D. Cost plus contract
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
When the performing organization lacks the in-house staff needed to complete a project, the required services may be acquired from outside sources. Time and materials contracts can resemble fixed-price contracts when unit rates are used, for example. Unit rates might be used to preset the rates of certain elements or portions of the project. For example, a contracting agency might charge you $150 per hour for a .NET programmer, or a leasing company might charge you $2,000 per month for the hardware you are leasing during the testing phase of your project, or salary of the design engineer/month is $7,000, and so on.

Q24You are a buyer-side project manager and have given a contract to a small startup vendor. In the middle of the project, a vendor reported to you that he would not be able to deliver all the deliverables which are required to be completed as a part of this project. What could have been done differently by the project manager to know ability of the vendor to supply the required deliverables?

A. Giving the contract to the more experienced vendor
B. Reviewing the agreement regularly
C. Creating a statement of work (SOW) in sufficient detail
D. Performing procurement reviews regularly
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The contract should contain a detailed Statement of Work-not all contracts contain detailed Statement of Work (SOW). The project manager is managing a project where a portion of the project scope will be subcontracted to a vendor company. In a procurement situation such as this, the company that is contracting the work (buyer) creates a procurement statement of work (SOW) that describes the contracted work in sufficient detail to allow the seller/vendor/subcontractor to be able to determine if they are capable of providing the goods and or services to the company(Buyer). Failure to perform against the SOW-this is a vendor failure and points out the importance of (1) the clarity of the SOW (this assists not just you but the vendor in assessing performance) and (2) the need to manage the vendor to ensure that they are performing against the SOW.

Q25A project manager is managing a construction project. The project sponsor calls him and asks what the probability of completing the project after 12 months is. What technique is the project manager likely to use to carry out this activity?

A. Sensitivity analysis
B. Decision tree analysis
C. Monte Carlo analysis
D. Influence diagram
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Monte Carlo analysis is a type of simulation technique that calculates hundreds to thousands of possible scenarios that could occur against a project objective (such as achieving budget or completion date). It considers the combined effects of project risks and other variables to generate the likely outcomes.
Because of the complexity of this simulation technique, it is performed using simulation software or similar tools. When the simulation is complete, we have a large number of results from the model, each based on random input values. These results are used to describe the likelihood, or probability, of reaching various results in the model. It is important to remember that the simulation only represents probabilities and not certainty. Nevertheless, Monte Carlo simulation can be a valuable tool when forecasting an unknown future.

A. Provide training for the project team to avoid such a situation in the future meetings
B. Set objectives of the meeting clearly, so all the attendees are aware of the meeting objectives
C. Rewards and recognitions are usually the best forms of authority that a project manager can use to prevent such a situation
D. Communicate the ground rules and ensure they are followed in all meetings Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Ground rules are defined in the team charter and are expectations set by the project manager and project team that describe acceptable team behavior. For example, one of my friends is team members who interrupt each other. In this case, one of the ground rules is one person speaks at a time during a meeting, another example, a team member leaves the project early. In this case, one of the ground rules is to identify the number of working hours such as; 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Monday-Friday, and 40 hours a week. Outlining ground rules like this helps the team understand expectations regarding acceptable behavior and increases productivity. Ground rules should also include expectations for stakeholder engagement. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 50, and 528]

Q28You are a project manager for a construction project. Midway through the project, you have experienced cost overruns and schedule delays as a result of many change requests that were not approved by the change control board. To avoid the cost overruns and schedule delays in future projects, which of the following processes should be revisited?

A. Implement risk response plan process
B. Corrective action should have been put into place to keep the project on track with the budget and/or schedule
C. Control risks
D. Perform integrated change control process
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The project manager is responsible for performing and overseeing the Perform Integrated Control process.
Just because a change is requested does not mean you have to implement it. Change requests may require information on estimated schedule impacts and estimated cost impacts prior to approval. Whenever a change request may impact any of the project baselines, a formal integrated change control process is always required. Implementing change requests without analyzing their impacts on all constrains (cost, scope, time, risk, and quality) will cause cost overruns and project delay.

Q29In your project, if earned value (EV) is $60,000, actual cost (AC) is $85,000, and planned value (PV) is $75,000. What is the approach that you plan to use?

A. Overtime
B. Crashing
C. Resource leveling
D. Fast tracking
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
SPI = EV/PV = 60,000/75,000 = 0.8 < I (behind schedule). CPI = EV/AC = 60,000/85,000 = 0.71 < 1 (over budget) Based on the SPI, and the CPI, the project is behind schedule and currently over budget. Since crashing is typically a costly option, the project manager is likely to fast-track activities on the critical path where possible.

Q60You are performing the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process and want to determine which risk event has the greatest potential for impact by examining all the uncertain elements at their baseline values. Which of the following tool will you use?

A. Probability and impact matrix
B. Risk probability and impact assessment
C. Tornado diagram
D. Bubble chart
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Tornado diagram is a type of sensitivity analysis in quantitative method of analyzing the potential impact of risk events on the project and determining which risk event (or events) has the greatest potential for impact by examining all the uncertain elements at their baseline values. You can see by the arrangement of horizontal bars (each representing a sensitivity variable) how the diagram gets its name. The idea is that each sensitivity bar displays the low and high value possible for the element the bar represents. The questions you might encounter on the exam (at least 3 questions) are focused on the context of this type of analysis. The variables with the greatest effect on the project appear at the top of the graph and decrease in impact as you progress down through the graph. This gives you a quick overview of how much the project can be affected by uncertainty in the various elements. It also allows you to see at a glance which risks might have the biggest impacts on the project and will require carefully crafted, detailed response plans.
You can use tornado diagrams to determine sensitivity in cost, time, and quality objectives or for risks you have identified during this process. Sensitivity analysis can also be used to determine stakeholder risk threshold levels. Option A. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. Option D. A bubble chart displays three dimensions of data, where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented by the x-axis value, the y-axis value, and the bubble size.

Q63A risk has actually occurred. The risk manager reviewed the risk register and found this risk was not identified. As a project manager, how should you deal with this negative risk event?

A. Risk management plan updates
B. Implement a workaround
C. Additional risk identification
D. Implement a contingency plan
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Workarounds are unplanned responses. They deal with negative risk events as they occur. As the name implies, workarounds were not previously known to the project team. The risk event was unplanned, so no contingency plan existed to deal with the risk event, and thus it required a workaround. (However, a workaround not mentioned in the PMBQK Guide, 6th. Edition. But you must know the concept behind a workaround for the PMP Exam!)

Q64You are the project manager for your organization, and you have project team members within the various departments of the organization; all have roles and responsibilities in the project. As the project manager, you might connect between work packages, or activities, and project team members and display this information in which of the following ways?

A. Organizational breakdown structure (OBS)
B. Work breakdown structures (WBS)
C. Resource breakdown structure
D. Assignment Matrix (RAM)
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can define the responsibilities of a project team, group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority for specific activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated with one person and all people associated with one activity.
This also ensures that there is only one person accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. Option A, and option B. incorrect answers, as the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) identifies the work to be done, the Organization Breakdown Structure (OBS) identifies the people that will do the work. The organization Breakdown Structure looks like a family tree chart that shows all the people in the family over many generations and their relationship to one another.

Q66Your organization has modern, up-to-date technology, as part of a strategy to handle negative risk. You and your team have decided to conduct more tests because of the high risk associated with the modern technology. What type of risk strategy are you using?

A. Mitigation
B. Exploitation
C. Avoidance
D. Transfer
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
According to the PMBOK Guide, 6th. Edition, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. It is easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of a risk event or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it has occurred. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 443]

Q68You are managing a software project, and after conducting a bidder conference, you receive an email from one of the bidders requesting additional information. The information was neither included in your request for proposal (RFP) nor did anyone ask for it during the bidder conference.
What are you likely to do next?

A. Send the required information by email to only the vendor who requested the information
B. Send the required information by email to all vendors who have submitted the proposals
C. You should hold the bidder conference again and explain the importance of the point that was initially missed
D. Create a revised RFP containing the new information and send it by email to all vendors Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Create a revised RFP containing the new information and send it by email to all vendors, explaining the required information, and receiving updated responses to the RFP in this scenario would be fair to all vendors.
It may not be practical or cost effective to conduct another bidder conference, especially as other aspects of the project have already been covered in the bidding conference, which was already held. Apart from fairness, you are ensuring that your requirements are understood. Another benefit of sending out a revised RFQ would be receiving back more viable bids from other vendors. Option B. May sound reasonable, but it is better to send a revised (RFP) instead of sending only the required information, so the best answer is option D.

Q72Which conflict resolution technique offers project managers the best option for resolution?

A. Smooth/accommodate
B. Collaborate/problem solving
C. Compromise/reconcile
D. Direct/force
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Common ways of handling conflicts: (1) Collaboration/ problem solving, where individuals of equal competencies work through a mutual problem-solving approach, with each party contributing valuable parts of the total solution. (2) Compromising/reconcile, where a quick decision needs to be made, and the issue at hand is one where it is appropriate to meet in the middle. (3) Avoiding, where it makes sense to let things slide, incurring good will on a subject or issue that is not crucial. (4) Accommodating/Smoothing, which involves the action of deferring to the other person, allowing them to have their way. This approach also can create good will and allows the other party to have a win. (4) Direct/force: Use your power as the PM to tell your project team members what they to do. Forcing does not help resolve the underlying problems, it reduces team moral, and it almost never a good-long term solution. Now which of these stands out as the best one to you? Of course, it is Collaborate/Problem Solving! When presented with a list of conflict management options, this one is always the correct one to choose. There are two main types of conflict management questions you will be asked to answer: 1) Identify the approach used. 2) Recommend a conflict management approach, which is usually Collaborate/Problem Solve.

Q74You are the project manager working on construction for a new wastewater treatment plant project. Your preliminary project schedule runs past the due date for a federal grant program. The Project sponsor has agreed to release 7 resources to work on your project to meet the federal grant program date. This is an example of:

A. Crashing
B. East tracking
C. Resource leveling
D. The critical chain method
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Crashing the schedule is accomplished by adding resources -- from either inside or outside the organization -- to the critical path tasks. In this scenario, the Project sponsor has agreed to release 7 resources, so we will crash the project schedule by adding the additional resources, and crashing is expensive because more resources are added to the project. Option B. Fast tracking is a technique where activities that would have been performed sequentially using the original schedule are performed in parallel. In other words, fast tracking a project means the activities are worked on simultaneously instead of waiting for each piece to be completed separately. But fast tracking can only be applied if the activities in question can actually be overlapped. Fast tracking will work only for activities that can be overlapped. Option C. The project manager can accomplish resource leveling in a couple of other ways as well. You might delay the start of a task to match the availability of a key team member, or you might adjust the resource assignments so that more tasks are given to team members who are under allocated. Option D. Critical chain method is a schedule network analysis technique that will modify the project schedule by accounting for limited or restricted resources, or for unforeseen project issues, by adding buffers to any schedule path.

Q76In your project, if earned value (EV) = 50,000, actual cost (AC) = 30,000, and planned value = 65,000. What can you determine about the project?

A. The project is ahead of schedule and under budget
B. The project is ahead of schedule and over budget
C. The project is behind schedule and under budget
D. The project is behind schedule and over budget
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
EV= 50,000 (given), AC = 30,000 (given), and PV = 65,000 (given). Based on the values provided, we can calculate CPI, SPI. CPI = EV/AC = 50,000/30,000 = 1.667 > 1 (under budget) SPI = EV/PV = 50,000/65,000 = 0.77 < 1 (behind schedule). When you see an SPI that is lower than 1, that means your project is behind schedule, and your CPI is greater than 1, which means that your project is under budget.

The question asks what is to complete performance index (TCPI). The best way to describe it is with an example. Suppose you are driving your car to meet a friend at a movie theater. You told your friend you would meet him there by 7:00 pm. You live 30 miles away and left home at 6:00 pm. It is now 6:30 pm and you have only driven 1Q miles. You have 20 miles to go (you have averaged 20 mph for the first 30 minutes due to traffic). What speed must you average for the last 20 miles in order to arrive on time? BAC = 400,000 (given) EV = 3.5/4X 400,000 = 350,000 (since 3.5 buildings are completed out of 4) AC= 100,000 + 100,000 + 120,000+ 40,000 = 360,000 PV = 3/4 X 400,000 = 300,000 (The cost of work that has been authorized/3 years) TCPI = (BAC-EV) / (BAC-AC) TCPI = (400,000-350,000) / (400,000-360,000) 50,000/40,000 = 1.25 = 125%.

Q79Your project was just completed. Because of some unfortunate circumstances, the project was delayed, causing cost overruns at the end of the project. Which of the following documents must be updated FIRST?

A. Lessons learned repository
B. Enterprise environmental factors (EEEs)
C. Work performance reports
D. Issue log
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Your project completed (you are in the close project or phase process), Historical information and lessons learned are update as part of the organizational process assets update. Lessons learned are used to document the successes and failures of the project. You should collate all of the lessons learned throughout the project and hold one last comprehensive review of the project. As an example, lessons learned document the reasons specific corrective actions were taken, their outcomes, the causes of performance variances, unplanned risks that occurred, mistakes that were made and that could have been avoided, and so on. Unfortunately, sometimes projects do fail. You can learn lessons from failed projects as well as from successful projects, and you should document this information for future reference. Most project managers, however, do not document lessons learned. The reason for this is that employees do not want to admit to making mistakes or learning from mistakes made during the project. They do not want their names associated with failed projects or even with mishaps on successful projects. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 128]

C. The process is out of control. The assignable cause should then be investigated and determined
D. This is the rule of seven, so statistically the data does not matter Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Since three data points fall outside of the control limits, then the process is said to be out of control. The assignable cause should then be investigated and determined. The PMBOK Guide on page 3Q4 describes how to know if a process is out of control: (1) a data point exceeds a control limit (2) 7 or more consecutive plot points are above the mean (3) 7 or more consecutive plot points are below the mean. Corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains outside the control limits.. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 304]

C. Expert judgment, data analysis, and decision making
D. Expert judgment, data gathering, and interpersonal and team skills Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The three tools and techniques of Close Project or Phase are expert judgment, data analysis (document analysis, regression analysis, trend analysis, variance analysis), and meetings. When you are conducting administrative closure activities, the subject matter experts can help ensure that the process is performed according to the organizational and project management standards. The data analysis tool and technique include analyzing documents to identify lessons learned and capturing knowledge for future projects.
Regression analysis helps determine why the project performed the way it did by examining different variables on the project and determining how those variables contributed to the outcomes of the project.
This is for improving future projects. Trends use past performance to help determine future performance.
Variance analysis examines and compares what was planned against what actually took place. Meetings in this process are used to validate that the exit criteria for the project have been met; for final reviews or validation of the deliverables, lessons learned, and closeout contracts; to measure stakeholder satisfaction, and to celebrate success.

Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Ishikawa diagrams or Cause-and-effect diagrams (also known as fishbone diagrams) show the relationship between the effects of problems and their causes and help identify the root cause of the problem. This diagram depicts every potential cause and sub-cause of a problem and the effect they have on the problem.
The causes of the problem make up the fish bones on this diagram, and the effect is shown as the head of the fish. These diagrams can be depicted horizontally (with the head or effect to the right) or vertically (with the head or effect on top). Each of the branches that extend from the spine lists a cause. All of the issues that contribute to that cause are shown as offshoots on the branch. This diagram is also called a why-why diagram. Option C. incorrect answer because Control charts are used to determine whether or not a process is stable or has predictable performance. Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements and reflect the maximum and minimum values allowed. Option D. Incorrect answer; When flowcharts are used to represent the steps in a process, they are sometimes called process flows or process flow diagrams and they can be used for process improvement as well as identifying where quality defects can occur or where to incorporate quality checks.

Q86As a Project Manager, you want a detailed cost estimation, and your team is using the work breakdown structure (WBS) in the estimating process. Which techniques are you most likely to use?

A. Analogous estimating
B. Expert judgment
C. Bottom-up estimating
D. Numerical estimating
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Bottom-Up Estimating. A method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower-level components of the work breakdown structure (WBS). Bottom-up estimating is performed by obtaining individual estimates for each project activity and then adding all of them up together to come up with a total estimate for the work package. Bottom-up estimating is a good technique to use when you are not confident about the type or quantity of resources you will need for the project. This is an accurate means of estimating, provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are accurate. However, it takes a considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because every activity must be assessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation. The smaller and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Pages 244, and 700]

Q87You are the project manager for a seller who has been selected to construct a large residential complex project. The scope of work is not completely defined, and management wants you to begin work immediately. What type of contract should you ask for in negotiations?

A. Time and material
B. Fixed price
C. Fixed price with economic price adjustments
D. Cost-reimbursable
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The scope of work is not completely defined. In that case, the project is at a higher risk, and the full amount of the material costs is not known at the time the contract is awarded. The time and material contract is used when a precise statement of work cannot be quickly prescribed. This type of contract is especially useful for projects where the scope is difficult to define and protects the seller from cost overruns, although the buyer will be the one bearing the risk of loss. One advantage is that vendor relations are generally better under this type of contract, provided project phases are put into place. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 472]

A. Acceptance
B. Avoidance
C. Mitigation
D. Transference
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:

Acceptance strategy. In this scenario there is no proactive action is taken (This is done with risks that are below the risk tolerance level or risks with low-impact). The acceptance strategy is used when you are not able to eliminate all the threats on the project and/or you are willing to accept the impacts of the risk.
Acceptance of a risk event is a strategy that can be used for risks that pose either threats or opportunities to the project and is generally used for low-impact risk events. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs.

B. Include the feature, as it will improve customer satisfaction
C. Request additional funds to implement the new feature
D. Analyze the impact of the new feature with your project team members Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The best thing to do in such scenarios is to analyze the impact on the triple constraints. It is quite possible that the cost andior the project schedule may increase. At the beginning of all projects, you should require two things regarding change. First, require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure there is no confusion about what is requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change. Second, require that all change requests must go through the formal change control system. Make sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the project manager knowing about them. Furthermore, make certain your stakeholders understand that going around the project manager can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and that it is not good change management practice. From the beginning of the project, encourage the stakeholders to use the formal procedures laid out in the change control system to request changes.

Q92You are managing a construction project. You are currently estimating the duration of a very critical activity. The subject matter expert is estimating 19 weeks; you have asked a team member to come up with an estimate, and his estimate is 20 weeks. However, the customer estimate is 24 weeks. What duration will you put into your schedule for this activity if you do not want any scenario to weigh more than any of the others?

A. 18 weeks
B. 20 weeks
C. 21 weeks
D. 24 weeks
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Triangular distributions use estimates based on the three-point estimate (the pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic values). You will gather these pieces (3 estimates or 3 points) of information from your experts (SMEs,
project team, consultant, and customer, etc.). Then you will use them to quantify durations or costs for each WBS element. In this scenario: P (pessimistic) = 24 weeks, 0 (optimistic) = 19 weeks, and M (most likely) = 20 weeks. In this scenario you do not want any scenario to weigh more than any of the others (in PERT or Beta the most likely estimate is multiplied by 4, it weights the average towards the most likely estimate), so in this scenario, we will use Triangular distributions). Triangular distributions equation = (P+M+0)/3. (24+20 +19)/3 = 21 days (option c). [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 201]

Q109You are a project manager managing a global project. You have team members located in 5 countries. Due to the nature of the project, you are unable to find a time that is acceptable to all team members. Which conflict resolution technique is best suited for this situation?

A. Force / direct
B. Collaborate / problem solving
C. Avoid / withdrawal
D. Compromise
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
A compromise requires searching for options that bring some degree to satisfaction to all parties in order to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This would be the best way to handle the current situation as the difference of time zone is not under the control of anyone. This may result in a lose-lose situation. On the positive side, if the conflict is not that important or if a quick resolution is required.
Option A. Force (direct) -- in this technique one person pushes their viewpoint at the expense of another.
This will lead to a win-lose solution. This technique may be the best technique in an emergency, especially an emergency that deals with safety or security.
Option B. Collaborate (problem solving) -- in this technique we work with the other party to find a win-win.
While this method may take more time than the others, it often leads to a more beneficial result for both parties. For this method to work, a high level of trust in each other and commitment to resolving the conflict needs to be present and need face to face communication.
Option C. Withdrawal (avoid) -- in this technique we walk away from a conflict. If we walk away with the idea to never address the conflict, this is very bad. If we walk away to calm down, or be better prepared with facts then a temporary withdrawal can be a good thing. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 349]

Q163You are a project manager for a manufacturing company; the product development lifecycle expects many changes during the course of the project and would also require continuous stakeholder involvement. The most preferred project lifecycle for your project is the:

A. Predictive life cycle
B. Contract life cycle
C. Adaptive life cycle
D. Waterfall life cycle
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Adaptive life cycles are incremental or iterative. The scope is defined at the beginning of an iteration (predetermined periods of time) and is progressively elaborated over future iterations. Choose this method when active participation of your stakeholders is required throughout the project, and when you are not certain of all the requirements at the beginning of the project, or when you work in a changing environment and would also require continuous stakeholder involvement. This life cycle produces deliverables, or portions of deliverables, in short periods of time. Each iteration must produce something that is ready for release at the end of the time period, and as such, the time period and the resources are fixed. All iterations require the Planning process group, and most will perform all of the project management process groups.
Option A and option D incorrect answers; in a predictive life cycle, the project scope, time, and cost are determined in the early phases of the life cycle. Any changes to the scope are carefully managed and there are not many changes during the course of the project. Predictive life cycles may also be referred to as waterfall life cycles.

These costs are manifested early in the process and include aspects such as Plan Quality Management, training, equipment, documenting, and taking the time to do things right. 2.
Appraisal Costs: Appraisal costs are the costs expended to examine the product or process and make certain the requirements are being met. Appraisal costs might include costs associated with aspects such as inspections and testing. Prevention and appraisal costs are often passed on to the acquiring organization because of the limited duration of the project. 3. Failure Costs: Failure costs are what it costs when things do not go according to plan. Failure costs are also known as cost of poor quality. Two types of failure costs exist: i. Internal Failure Costs These result when customer requirements are not satisfied while the product is still in the control of the organization. Internal failure costs might include corrective action, rework, scrapping, and downtime. ii. External Failure Costs External failure costs, unfortunately, are when the customer determines that the requirements have not been met. Costs associated with external failure costs might include inspections at the customer site, warranty work, returns, liabilities, lost business, and additional customer service costs.

Q183In your project, you are now interested in determining the best corrective action in terms of cost in case of project deviations. You should use:

A. Root cause analysis
B. Variance analysis
C. Cost-benefit analysis
D. Earned value analysis
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Cost-benefit analysis helps to determine the best corrective action in terms of cost in case of project deviations. Variance analysis reviews the differences (or variance) between planned and actual performance. Root cause analysis focuses on identifying the main reasons of a problem. It can be used to identify the reasons for a deviation and the areas the project manager should focus on in order to achieve the objectives of the project. Earned value provides an integrated perspective on scope, schedule, and cost performance. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 356]

What plan should you create to ensure that the resources are scheduled, released, and managed effectively?

A. Project management plan
B. Schedule management plan
C. Stakeholders engagement plan
D. Project team plan
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The question asks about the resource management plan which is a component of the project management plan. The resource management plan is the component of the project management plan that provides guidance on how project resources should be categorized, allocated, managed, and released. It also helps in establishing an effective project team by defining the types of resources needed during the project, documenting when they are needed, and providing direction regarding how the resources should be managed. What makes this question challenging is that the resource management plan is not listed as an answer choice. There will likely be instances on the actual PMP exam where the obvious answer is not available, and the best option of the available responses must be selected. In this case, the resource management plan is a component of the project management plan. Therefore, among the available choices, the project management plan is the best answer to the question asked.

Q186A project is slipping on its schedule. Management is worried that the project will be late and that this will cost the organization several thousand dollars in fines and penalties. They have asked the project manager to use a schedule duration compression technique that will help the project finish on time. The technique that the project manager can use, however, should not add costs to the project. What duration compression technique should the project manager use in this instance?

A. Fast tracking
B. Leads and lags
C. Crashing
D. Resource optimization
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Fast tracking is the best answer in this scenario. Costs were the original constraint on this project, so it is unlikely the project manager would get more resources (crashing = costs) to assist with the project. Fast tracking can increase project risk and might cause the project team to have to rework tasks. Crashing often increases the costs of the project. Also consider that crashing does not always come up with a reasonable result as well. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 215]

Q187You are managing a software development project. During the implementation phase, you find that one of the key project stakeholders has low authority regarding project decisions. However, you recently discovered that he has high interest in your project. What stakeholder management strategy should you use with the key project stakeholder?

A. Keep the key stakeholder satisfied
B. Manage the key stakeholder closely
C. Monitor the key stakeholder
D. Keep the key stakeholder informed
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Correct answer: D. A power/interest grid is a classification model used for stakeholder analysis and management that groups the stakeholders based on their level of authority (power) and their level of concern (interest) regarding project outcomes. The classification and recommended management strategies are as follows: 1) Low-power (authority)/low-interest(concern): monitor only 2) Low-power (authority)/high-interest (concern): keep informed 3) High-power (authority)/low-interest (concern): keep satisfied 4) High-power (authority)/high-interest (concern): manage closely. Based on this scenario, the key stakeholder can be classified as Low-power (authority) and high-interest (concern); therefore, the correct answer is to keep the key stakeholder informed (option D)

Q188You are a project manager for a large project. Early on, you can identify a number of risks in the project and want to prepare them, and during the implementation phase, you have identified a potential risk. You have identified the response strategy for this risk, you have decided to purchase insurance to deal with this risk; however, buying insurance will cost you $500. This is an example of which risk response strategy?

A. Transference
B. Acceptance
C. Mitigation
D. Avoidance
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The idea behind a risk transfer is to transfer the risk and the consequences of that risk to a third party. The risk has not gone away, but the responsibility for the management of that risk now rests with another party.
This strategy will impact the project budget ($ 500), and should be included in the cost estimate exercises, if you know you are going to use it. Transfer of risk can occur in many forms but is most effective when dealing with financial risks. Insurance is one form of risk transfer. You are probably familiar with how insurance works. Car insurance is a good example. You purchase car insurance so that if you come upon.
Other forms of transference include warranties, guarantees, and performance bonds. Option B.
Acceptance: This strategy indicates that the project team has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify any other suitable response strategy. (strategy for both threats and Opportunities) Examples: active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks. Option C. Mitigation: is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a risk.
Examples: prototypes, and renting a generator into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the electricity. Option D. Avoid: It usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat entirely. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 443]

A. Collect Requirements
B. Create WBS
C. Plan Scope Management
D. Develop the project charter
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Create WBS is the process after the define scope process. Create WBS is the process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable components. The key benefit of this process is that it provides a framework of what has to be delivered. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project.

A. Communicate the impact with the customer
B. Evaluate the impact of this delay
C. Explore options to crash or fast track the project
D. Change the schedule management plan to reflect the new due date Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The impact has already been determined and crashing or fast tracking would have already been done as part of determining the impact. Changing the schedule management plan only hides the problem and is unethical. You should discuss the impact of the delay with the customer.
