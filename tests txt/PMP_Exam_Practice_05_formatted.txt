Q44You have a project in which you are responsible for building a condo complex in a resort town. The project is expected to take two years to complete. During your work breakdown structure meeting, you have decomposed many deliverables into work packages and schedule activities. However, there are some work packages that will occur a year from now, so you have elected not to decompose those deliverables and work packages at this time. This is an example of what tool or technique?

A. Scope Creep
B. Poor Planning
C. Rolling Wave Planning
D. Time-delayed Decomposition
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The correct answer is rolling wave planning. Rolling wave planning is a form of progressive elaboration and is used when the project management team does not have enough information for a phase or deliverable that will occur far into the future.

Q45Lucy has recently been assigned as the project manager for a new shopping mall construction project. Since the project will span well over five years, Lucy is a bit hesitant to use the current market rates for estimating construction materials cost. The prices have been steadily increasing and the current market rates might not remain valid in the future. Which of the following techniques can Lucy apply to determine her project budget?

A. Conduct a trend analysis on the cost of materials and use that to extrapolate the cost of materials in the future.
B. Determine the cost of the project using current market rates and increase the total budget by some factor.
C. Compute the Net Present Value of the cost of materials and use that to determine the project budget.
D. Use Rolling Wave Planning to determine the budget as the project progresses.
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Conduct a trend analysis on the cost of materials and using that to extrapolate the cost of materials in the future is the best response. Trend analysis is used to forecast future based on past results. This is most probably the only choice available to Lucy if she is required to determine the project budget today. Other choices are incorrect as they can't produce better results. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 111]

Q48You have recently joined an organization as the procurements manager. You have just received an invoice from a contractor. Some of the items from the invoice are as follows: EV of work completed to date:
$50,000. AC of work completed to date: $40,000. Total costs reimbursed by the buyer to date: $35,000. If the contract between the buyer and the contractor is a CPIF contract, what is the total value payable to this contractor? (Assume that the contract allows for a 10 percent fee over net payable whenever CPI > 1).

A. $500
B. $5,500
C. $44,000
D. $55,000
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Since this is a CPIF (Cost plus incentive fee) contract, the fee is calculated as a percentage of the actual cost provided that the CPI is greater than 1. In this case CPI is greater than one (i.e. CPI = 1.25) and hence 10% fee is applicable on the total cost reimbursable. AC is $40k out of which $35k has already been reimbursed. Hence total cost reimbursable is $5k. The total payable in this case is $5k x 1.1 = $5,500.
