Q44Which of the following is accurate regarding the Estimate Activity Resources process?

A. It produces project resource calendars as the output.
B. It determines dependencies that may require a lead or lag to define the relationship.
C. This process is coordinated independent of the Estimate Cost process.
D. It involves determining what and how many resources to use.
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
- The Estimate Activity Resources process determines what and how many resources will be used. This process is closely coordinated with the Estimate Costs process. Activity leads and lags are not determined during this process. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 320] [Project Schedule Management]

Q45In a project, Activity A has a duration of four days and begins on the morning of Monday the fourth. The successor Activity, B, has a Finishto-Start (FS) relationship with A. The Finish-to-Start relationship has two days of lag, and Activity B has a duration of three days. If Saturday and Sunday are non-working days, which of the following statements is true?

A. Total elapsed days (completing both activities) is seven days
B. Activity B will be completed by the end of the day on Thursday, the 14th
C. Activity B will be completed by the end of the day on Friday, the 15th.
D. Activity B will be completed by the end of the day on Tuesday, the 12th Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Activity A has a duration of 4 days and completes by end of the day on Thursday, 7th. There is a 2-day lag, and since Saturday and Sunday are non-working, Activity B can begin only on Tuesday, 12th. Activity B has a duration of 3 days and completes by end of the day on Thursday, 14th. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 192] [Project Schedule Management]

A. Uses statistical relationship between historical data and other variables
B. Generally less accurate
C. Bottom-up estimating
D. Generally accurate
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Analogous cost estimating is usually deemed less accurate than other methods of estimation. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 200] [Project Cost Management]

Q47What is the best way to make an accurate forecast of ETC?

A. EAC - AC
B. BAC " EV
C. Manual forecasting of cost of the remaining work.
D. (BAC " EV)/CPI
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Manual forecasting of costs of remaining work is the most common forecasting approach. It is generally considered the best means of generating an accurate forecast of ETC. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 264] {For any project, the estimate to complete (ETC) is the money required to finish the project. The most accurate way to figure this value out is to do a bottom-up estimate for the remaining project work under the light of current project conditions. However, this approach is time-consuming and cannot be carried out frequently during the project. This technique is only used when we think that either significant scope of work has been changed, or there has been significant changes in the project conditions, and hence, we cannot accurately predict the future based on project performance to date. If such extreme conditions are not present, usually we try to predict ETC quickly using formulas based on current performance. All ETC/EAC formulas are rooted in current project perform

Q48Which of the following is not a valid instance of risk transference?

A. Use of a Cost Reimbursable contract
B. Warranties
C. Fixed Price contracts
D. Performance bonds
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
A cost-reimbursable contract does not transfer risk to the seller; rather, the risk is with the buyer. Risk transference involves shifting the negative impact of a risk, along with the ownership of the response, to a third party. Risk transference nearly always involves payment of a premium to the party taking on the risk.
Examples include performance bonds, warranties, and fixed price contracts. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 443] [Project Risk Management]

Q49Under which of the following scenarios would you not use a decision tree?

A. When some future scenarios are unknown
B. When you need to look at the implications of not choosing certain alternatives
C. When the future scenarios are known
D. When the outcomes of some of the actions are uncertain
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
You would use a decision tree when uncertainty and unknowns exist regarding future scenarios and their outcomes, not when future scenarios are known. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 435] [Project Risk Management]

Q50You have been assigned as a project manager of a new project to be executed out of New York. However, you determine the project requires a Global Positioning Systems expert who is not available within the company in New York. After doing a little checking, you determine that the company has an expert based in London who is suitable for the project. However, the London-based employee is not willing to relocate to New York for the project. In such a case:

A. Write to the manager of the London-based employee and inform him that the employee needs to be convinced to relocate to New York due to project requirements.
B. You look at the option of moving ahead with the project by using a virtual team.
C. Manage the project without the key resource and flag this as a risk.
D. Co-location of resources is a key factor for the success of projects. As per PMI guidelines, you cannot proceed with the project since the resources are not available in New York.
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The use of virtual teams has created possibilities of having teams in different global locations who are working towards a common goal. The availability of email and videoconferencing has made such teams possible. Virtual teams do present additional challenges, but these can be managed in most cases. The other choices are not valid.
