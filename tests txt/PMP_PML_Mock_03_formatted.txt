Q5A project manager is working on a software development project. He has developed the risk management plan, identified risks, and created risk responses for most of the identified project risks. However, the project manager found the current risk response plan ineffective in dealing with overall project risks, and there are delays in implementing the risk responses. To avoid the delay of implementing the risk response plans if the risk event occurs, what should the project manager do next?

A. Allocate contingency reserves to account for risks
B. Update the risk management plan
C. Assign risk owners
D. Perform a qualitative risk analysis process
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
For the exam, Risks need to be assigned to someone to manage (Risk Owners). Without an accountable person to watch for the event, implement proactive responses, and notice when changes in the environment affect the risk, you cannot expect to be able to respond effectively. Risk owners are the departments or individuals responsible for monitoring the risks, implementing risk response plans if the risk event occurs, and updating the project team on status. Where a potential risk owner has been identified during the Identify Risks process, the risk owner is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Risk responses should also be timely, agreed to by all the project stakeholders, and assigned to an individual (risk owner) who is responsible for monitoring and carrying out the risk response plan if needed.

A. Evaluate the impact, and submit a change request to the change control board (CCB)
B. Nothing, the project remains off track until closure
C. Update the scope baseline
D. Notify the project sponsor
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Uncontrolled growth in project scope at any point after the project has begun is known as scope creep.
Scope creep has a negative effect on time, cost, and resources of the project and is a result of uncontrolled additions to the scope of the project outside of Change Management. The project manager will need first to analyze the impact of the scope creep on time, cost, quality and what options exist before notifying the project sponsor, such as whether to undo what has been completed or analyze whether the scope change go through the change control board for approval. The project manager cannot update any baselines without approved change request.

Q31You are the Project Manager and are currently in the monitoring process group. You and your team are trying to determine whether or not a process is stable or has predictable performance, and if the project management processes are in control. What tool will help with this?

A. Scatter diagram
B. Cause and Effect diagram
C. Control chart
D. Statistical sampling
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Control charts are used to determine whether or not a process is stable or has predictable performance.
Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements and reflect the maximum and minimum values allowed. For the exam, The Rule of 7 is another way for the project Manager to use control charts and determine if the process is in control. The Rule of 7 works like this. If seven consecutive points or more fall on one side of the mean, this may indicate there are factors influencing the result, and they should be investigated. So, while the overall results are within the control limits, the process may not necessarily be in control, and those factors should be examined more closely. A control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen and measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Control Quality is usually maintained-or said to be in control-within plus or minus three standard deviations. In other words, Control Quality says that if the process is in control (that is, the measurements fall within the control limits), you know that 99.73 percent of the parts going through the process will fall within an acceptable range of the mean. If you discover a part outside of this range, you should investigate and determine whether corrective action is needed. Option (A): A scatter diagram displays the relationship between two elements as points on the graph. These elements are the dependent and the independent variables.

Q33One of the team members missed an important component of the work break down structure (WBS) during the project planning. The project manager notices the missed part during the implementation phase. What should the project manager do next?

A. Meet with the sponsor to discuss the missed component, and negotiate for additional funding
B. Consider the missed component a risk and add it to the risk register
C. Evaluate the impact of the missed part, and submit a change request to the change control board (CCB) for approval
D. Call an emergency steering committee meeting to evaluate the impact of the missing part, create a change request and ask for approval
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
For the PMP exam, if the project manager has discovered that one of their team members had missed part, feature, functionality and/ or heishe discovered an error during the testing phase. The first thing the project manager should do is to evaluate the impact of the missing part (feature, and functionality), and then issue a change request. Ideally, before submitting a change request to the Change Control Board for review, the Project Manager would have to analyze it and understand its impact on the project constraints (time, cost, quality). Each change request might have an impact on cost, schedule, scope and quality. It is therefore very important as a project manager that you document all changes regardless of whether they are communicated via phone or emails. Once the impact is documented the changes need to be formally approved before the work can begin. Option B. We have not relevant information to consider the missed part as a risk, which should be analyzed for its potential impact (cost, time, quality, risk) before taking any further action. Option D. Call an emergency steering committee meeting, then create a change request and ask for approval, this option seems like a correct one, but what makes it wrong is hat change requests are not approved or rejected during steering committee meeting. They should be submitted to the CCB.

Q36You are managing a software development project. One of your team members makes a change to the project without letting you know. He assures you that it did not affect the cost, and it significantly enhances the product. What should you do next?

A. Find out if the CCB approved this change
B. Evaluate the impact of the change to understand how it affects scope, time, and cost, quality, and project risks
C. Submit the change to the CCB
D. Remove the team member from the project since he made the change without letting you know Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Evaluate the impact of the change request is the first thing we do when a change request comes to us, regardless of where the change request originated. Option (A) is wrong because the change control board (CCB) should never bypass the project manager to approve changes directly. It is duty of the project manager to authorize changes on the project. Option (C) is incorrect since all changes might not go to the change control board. Even if the change control board exists on the project. The project manager should first evaluate the impact of the change on all constraints. Option (D) is incorrect answer and never solve the problem.

Q37You are managing a construction project. You are currently estimating the duration of a very critical activity. The subject matter expert is estimating 10 weeks; you have asked a team member to come up with an estimate, and his estimate is 8 weeks. However, the customer estimate is 4 weeks. What duration should you put into your schedule for this activity?

A. 7.5 weeks
B. 7.667 weeks
C. 8.50 weeks
D. 8.667 weeks
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a method that the United States Navy developed in the 1950s. The Navy was working on one of the most complex engineering projects in history at the time- the Polaris Missile Program-and needed a way to manage the project and forecast the project schedule with a high degree of reliability. PERT was developed to do just that, where PERT = (Optimistic+ 4 X Most Likely + Pessimistic)/6. This is also known as the PERT Weighted Average Formula or the PERT Beta Distribution formula. You will use this formula to calculate duration: PERT = (Optimistic + 4 X Most Likely + Pessimistic)/
6. Optimistic (0) = 4 weeks, Most likely (ML) = 8 weeks, Pessimistic (P) = 10 weeks. Plug in the numbers: (4 + 4x8+ 10)/6 = 7.667 weeks. When considering beta distribution, another important formula to memorize for the exam is one used to calculate the standard deviation (expressed as a) for an estimate. (Pessimistic - Optimistic) + 6.

Q38As a project manager for a new construction project in Chicago, you and the project team are creating the scope statement and are evaluating the function, purpose, and activities that will take place within the project, to help the project customer gather all of the requirements for the scope. This process is an example of which one of the following?

A. Meeting
B. Expert judgment
C. Work breakdown structure creation
D. Product analysis
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Product analysis goes hand in hand with the product scope description and, therefore, is most useful when the outcome is a product. Product analysis is a method for converting the product description and project objectives into deliverables and requirements. According to the P M BOK Guide 6TH. EDITION, product analysis might include performing value analysis, product breakdown, requirements analysis, systems- engineering techniques, systems analysis, and value engineering techniques to further define the product or service. (A) is incorrect because meeting relies on experts to develop a portion of the detailed project scope statement. C is wrong because this is not an example of the WBS creation. For exam purposes, remember that product analysis is a tool and technique of the Define Scope process and memorize the list of analysis techniques that might be performed in this process.

Q47You are a project manager working on a software development project. When all the members are brought together, and introduced objectives of the project. During this stage, team members are interdependent and work through issues smoothly and effectively. Which of the following statements is true?

A. They are in the norming stage of team development
B. They are in the performing stage of team development
C. They are in the forming stage of team development
D. They are in the storming stage of team development
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Performing, Teams in the performing stage of team development, this stage is where great teams end up and where team members are productive and effective. The level of trust among team members is high, and great things are achieved. This is the mature development stage. Your role as project manager during this stage should be more focused on the project management processes than on the team itself. Teams in this stage are usually self-directed and will hum along smoothly, provided you continue to update them on project progress and keep the lines of communication open. Option A. Norming, now things begin to calm down. Team members know each other fairly well by now. They are comfortable with their positions in the team, and they begin to deal with project problems instead of people problems. In the norming stage, they confront the project concerns and problems instead of each other. Decisions are made jointly at this stage, and team members exhibit mutual respect and familiarity with one another. As the project manager, you should continue to hold team meetings, especially during this stage, because team members can fall back into the storming stage if left to their own devices. During this stage, you should intervene more often when conflicts arise to keep the team moving forward. Option C. Forming This one is easy. Forming isthe beginning stage of team formation, when all the members are brought together, introduced, and told the objectives of the project. This is where team members learn why they are working together. During this stage, team members tend to be formal and reserved and take on an all-business approach. Option D.
Storming is where the action begins. Team members become confrontational with each other as they are vying for position and control during this stage. They are working through who is going to be the top dog and jockeying for status. Your role as the project manager during this stage is to remind the team of the project goals and keep everyone centered on those goals. Conflicts are not bad in this case; they are necessary to get the team into the next stage. During this stage, it is best if you can limit your intervention and let team members resolve their own issues as often as possible. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 338]

Q48You are a project manager. The sponsor has requested you to provide duration estimates for your project, and you come across a similar project completed by your organization last year. To save time, you use information from this project to help estimate activity duration. This is an example of which tool or technique?

A. Bottom-up estimating
B. Parametric estimating
C. Three-point estimating
D. Analogous estimating
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future project. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity.
Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project. Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also less accurate. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 200]

Which of the following documents is most likely to get updated first as a result of the addition of this new stakeholder?

A. Project Management Plans
B. Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix
C. Stakeholder Engagement Plan
D. Change Management Plan
Correct Answer: C

The question asks about the stakeholder register which is a component of the stakeholder engagement plan. What makes this question challenging is that the stakeholder register is not listed as an answer choice. Where additional information on existing or new stakeholders is gathered as a result of this process, it is recorded in the stakeholder register. There will likely be instances on the actual PMP exam where the obvious answer is not available, and the best option of the available responses must be selected.

The best thing to do in such scenarios is to analyze the impact on the triple constraints. It is quite possible that the cost and/or the project schedule may increase. At the beginning of all projects, you should require two things regarding change. First, require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure there is no confusion about what is requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change. Second, require that all change requests must go through the formal change control system. Make sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the project manager knowing about them. Furthermore, make certain your stakeholders understand that going around the project manager can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and that it is not good change management practice. From the beginning of the project, encourage the stakeholders to use the formal procedures laid out in the change control system to request changes. For the Exam, you must know that: (Exam Essentials) Changes can come from: 1. The project manager 2. The sponsor 3. The customer 4. Project team, management or other stakeholders. Procedures to solve change requests questions on the exam. I. Analyze (Evaluate) the impact of the change on the project constrains (scope, cost, time and quality). 2. Create a change request.
3. Submit the change request to CCB. 4. The change is approved or reject. The approved changes are then implemented in the Direct and Manage Project Work Process. 5. Project documents updates: A-change log update (The first document must be updated after the change request approved) B- Baselines updates (scope baseline, cost baseline ...etc.) C.

Q58You are a project manager working on a software development project. You have developed the risk management plan, identified risks, and determined risk responses for the risks. You have recently identified risks in your project and decided not to change the project management plan to deal with the risk. The risk response strategy that you used in this scenario is an example of:

A. Mitigate
B. Transfer
C. Avoid
D. Acceptance
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Acceptance is often a perfectly reasonable strategy for dealing with risk, whether positive or negative. When accepting a risk, you are simply acknowledging that the best strategy may not be to avoid, transfer, mitigate, share, or enhance it. Instead, the best strategy may be simply to accept it and continue with the project.
Many people miss questions on the exam related to this, because they do not have the mindset that acceptance may be the best strategy if the cost or impact of the other strategies is too great. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. [PMBOK 6th Edition, Pages 443, 444]

Q61Your equipment supplier left you a voicemail saying that the Hurricane season in the Eastern North Pacific will prevent your equipment from arriving on time. You identified a risk response strategy for this risk and had arranged for a local company to lease you the needed equipment until yours arrives. This is an example of which risk response strategy?

A. Transfer
B. Acceptance
C. Mitigate
D. Avoid
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Mitigation attempts to reduce the impact of a risk event should it occurs. Making plans to arrange for the leased equipment reduces the consequences of the risk. When you mitigate a risk, you attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event occurring or reduce its impacts to an acceptable level. This strategy is a lot like defensive driving. You see an obstacle in the road ahead, survey your options, and take the necessary steps to avoid the obstacle and proceed safely on your journey. Seeing the obstacle ahead (identifying risk) allows you to reduce the threat by planning ways around it or planning ways to reduce its impact if the risk does occur (mitigation strategies). According to the PMBOK Guide, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. It is easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of a risk event or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it has occurred. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors. For the Exam, 1. Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats. Avoid: It usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat entirely. Examples: extending the schedule, changing the Strategy, or reducing scope. Transfer: is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact whereby the project team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, transferring the risk simply gives another party responsibility for its management-it does not eliminate it. Examples: Buy insurance, performance bonds, warranties guarantee, a fixed-price contract may transfer risk to the seller. Use of a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer. Mitigate: is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a risk. Examples: prototypes, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.
Accept: This strategy indicates that the project team has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify any other suitable response strategy. (strategy for both threats and Opportunities) Examples: active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks. 2. Strategies for Positive Risks or Opportunities Exploit: The exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized. Examples: assigning most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to realize project objectives. Enhance: The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an opportunity. Identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the probability of their occurrence. Examples: enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early. Share: Sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Examples: joint ventures. Accept: See previous strategies. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 443]

Q62A project manager is managing an IT project that is currently in the execution phase. The organization outsources the IT Help Desk to another vendor. Now he has a new risk that the vendor is not performing according to the specifications defined in the contract. What is the project manager likely to do next to take corrective action?

A. Delay the payment until the final deliverables are ready
B. Follow the change management plan
C. Ask their manager for guidance
D. Follow the communication management plan
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
As you perform the Plan Procurement, may require changes due to vendor availability, vendor performance, or the proposed solution of the vendor, as well as cost and quality considerations. Change requests must be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process by following the change management plan. Some project managers think that once the contract is signed, it cannot be change. This is a common mistake. A contract can be changed using a contract change control system. A contract change control system defines the process by which the procurement (or contract) can be modified. Since the vendor is not performing according to the specifications defined in the contract would allow the project manager to take a timely corrective action, then you have to use the formal contract change control system to change the contract andior the vendor in order to accommodate performance of the vendor. Option A.
delaying the payment until the work is completed while having suspicions of a defective performance may result in a situation where the final deliverables are ready, but will have to be reworked due to the bad performance that could have been prevented/corrected early. This is not a proactive approach. Option C.
incorrect, would be asking the top management to do the job of the project manager. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 489]

Q70As part of the Risk Response planning for your project, you are trying to come up with a strategy to deal with negative risks or threats. In order to eliminate the impact of a particular risk, you relax the objective that is in jeopardy by extending the project schedule. This is an example of:

A. Transference
B. Mitigation
C. Avoidance
D. Postponement
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
This is an example of avoidance. It involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat posed by an adverse risk, isolating the project objectives from the risk(s), or relaxing the objective that is in jeopardy, such as by extending the schedule or reducing scope. Transference involves shifting the negative impact of a threat along with the ownership of the response. Mitigation implies a reduction in the probability and impact of an adverse risk. Postponement is not a valid strategy since it does not address the risk.

Q90You are managing a software development project using an agile approach. You divided the project into five iterations that are typically time-boxed to 30 days. You are estimating activity durations for the first iteration, and when taking a vote, three of your five team members hold up one finger. You spend some time understanding their concerns, make some adjustments in the iteration, and finally come to an agreement. Which of the following techniques could prove to be helpful in this context?

A. Majority
B. Fist to five
C. Unanimity
D. Dictatorship
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The voting method that is often used in agile-based projects is called the fist of five (also called fist to five).
In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding up a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than three fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team.
The project manager continues the fist-of-five process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agrees to move on to the next decision. 1) 0 fingers (closed fist) means the voter has serious objections and will block the proposal. 2) 1 finger means the voter has strong reservations and wants to discuss issues and suggest changes that should be made. 3) 2 fingers mean the voter is moderately comfortable but has minor issues that may not need discussion. 4) 3 fingers mean the voter has a neutral standpoint because he likes some of it, but not all. 5) 4 fingers mean that the voter is supportive of the proposal. 6) All 5 fingers (show of the full palm) means the voter is in complete agreement with the proposal and will also promote it. Option (A) Majority: Support from more than 50/o. Option (C) Unanimity:
Everyone agrees on a single course of action. Option (D) Dictatorship: One individual makes decision to the team. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 203]

D. Start-to-Start relationship between the activities, with a 3-days lead on Activity 2 Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The best way to describe this scenario is with an example. If you are the PM for a housing painting project.
In order to paint, you first need to scrape the peeling paint and then prime. However, you cannot begin painting until the primer has dried (2-or 3-days lag), so you should not schedule priming for Monday and painting for Tuesday if you need the primer to dry on Tuesday. Therefore, the priming activity generates the need for lag time at the end of the activity to account for the drying time needed before you can start Painting. In this scenario (Imagine Task 1 is Painting, and Task 2 is Primer). Task 1 (Painting) can only be started 3 days (lag) after Task 2 started (until the primer has dried), then the relationship between task 1 and task 2: Start-to-Start relationship between the tasks with a 3-days lag on Task 1

Q110Your primary constraint is quality. To make certain the project team members do not feel too pressed for time and to avoid schedule risk, which of the following tools does not take into consideration risks when estimating the duration of project activities?

A. Analogous estimating
B. Beta
C. Triangular
D. Bottom-up estimating
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also less accurate. Option (B), and option (C): The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by
considering estimation uncertainty and risk. Using three-point estimates helps define an approximate range for activity duration. Option (D): Bottom-up estimating is a good technique to use when you are not confident about the type or quantity of resources you will need for the project. This is an accurate means of estimating, provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are accurate. However, it takes a considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because every activity must be assessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation. The smaller and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique. For the Exam, Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower level components of the WBS.

Q139You are a project manager working on a software development project. You have developed the risk management plan, identified risks, and determined risk responses for the risks. You have recently identified risks in your project and decided to establish a contingency reserve to deal with the risk. The risk response strategy that you used in this scenario is an example of:

A. Mitigation
B. Acceptance
C. Escalation
D. Avoidance
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Acceptance is often a perfectly reasonable strategy for dealing with risk, whether positive or negative. When accepting a risk, you are simply acknowledging that the best strategy may not be to avoid, transfer, mitigate, share, or enhance it. Instead, the best strategy may be simply to accept it and continue with the project.
Many people miss questions on the exam related to this, because they do not have the mindset that acceptance may be the best strategy if the cost or impact of the other strategies is too great. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed authority of the PM. Escalated risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the project level. [PMBOK 6th Edition, Pages 443, 444, and 445]

Q141The project management plan is complete and approved. However, a key stakeholder just discovered a problem and requests an adjustment to the project management plan. As a project manager, what should you do next?

A. Perform validate scope process
B. Make the adjustment to the project management plan
C. Implement a formal change request
D. Perform Integrated Change Control process
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Once the project management plan is complete and approved, it should be baselined. Most importantly, the scope, schedule and cost management plans must be baselined so that changes can be closely managed, and so that you have a point of reference to determine and measure project progress against for the remainder of the project. As the project progresses and more and more processes are performed, the subsidiary plans and the project management plan itself might change. After the project management plan is baselined, you will manage these changes using the Perform Integrated Change Control process. All changes should be reviewed following the processes outlined in the Change Management Plan, and the project management plan should be updated to reflect the approved changes.

As an example, lessons learned to document the reasons specific corrective actions were taken, their outcomes, the causes of performance variances, unplanned risks that occurred, mistakes that were made and that could have been avoided, and so on. Unfortunately, sometimes projects do fail. You can learn lessons from failed projects as well as from successful projects, and you should document this information for future reference. Most project managers, however, do not document lessons learned. The reason for this is that employees do not want to admit to making mistakes or learning from mistakes made during the project. They do not want their names associated with failed projects or even with mishaps on successful projects. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 128]

Q182You are a project manager for a construction project, and electrical power in your project frequently experiences outages. This affects the Internet Servers. As part of a strategy to handle this negative risk, you decided to rent a generator to run in case of power failure. This is an example of which risk response strategy?

A. Acceptance
B. Transference
C. Mitigation
D. Avoidance
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
Mitigation attempts to reduce the impact of a risk event should it occurs. Making plans to arrange for the rented generator reduces the consequences of the risk. When you mitigate a risk, you attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event occurring or reduce its impacts to an acceptable level. This strategy is a lot like defensive driving. You see an obstacle along the road ahead, survey your options, and take the necessary steps to avoid the obstacle and proceed safely on your journey. Seeing the obstacle ahead (identifying risk) allows you to reduce the threat by planning ways around it or planning ways to reduce its impact if the risk does occur (mitigation strategies). According to the PMBOK Guide, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. It is easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of a risk event or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it has occurred. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors. [PMBOK Sixth edition, Page 443]

Q200During your project meeting, a problem was discussed with one of the key stakeholders, and a resolution to the problem was reached. Sometime after the meeting, you received an email from him saying that he had changed his mind about the solution that was reached and needed to resurface the problem. The solution reached during the initial project meeting is a result of which of the following conflict resolution techniques?

A. Compromise/Reconcile
B. Smooth/Accommodate
C. Withdraw/Avoid
D. Force/Direct
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Reference:
The smoothing technique (also known as accommodate) does not usually result in a permanent solution.
The problem is downplayed to make it seem less important than it is, which makes the problem tend to resurface later. For the PMP Exam (there are at least 4 questions related to this topic). For the exam, know each of the conflict resolution techniques for the exam. Also remember that these techniques will not necessarily yield long-term results. The smoothing and withdrawal techniques have temporary results and are not always good techniques to use to resolve problems. Resolutions reached through forcing and compromise might not always be satisfying for all parties, but they tend to produce longer-lasting results.
Collaborating techniques are often successful and produce commitment to the decision provided all parties believe they had the opportunity to provide their opinions and ideas. [PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, Page 349]
