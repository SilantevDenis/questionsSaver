Q1At a division project status meeting, all attendees receive a dashboard of cost metrics for each project, and each project manager is presenting the status of his or her project. The metrics for one project show a BAC of $1100, an EV of $998, and an EAC of $1099. However, the project manager is reporting an ETC of $354.
What do you do?

A. Notify the appropriate management there is a calculation error
B. Do nothing
C. Advise the project manager to take the additional funds from her project contingency budget
D. Congratulate the project manager for being under budget

A. Jacks incompetence since he is dependent on Andrews opinion
B. An example of obtaining expert judgment from a senior
C. Unethical behavior by Jack since Andrew has already resigned from the company
D. A conflict of interest situation as Jack knows Andrew

Q11Tim is the project manager of a project that has a timeline of 18 months. Tim plans to send daily status reports to all stakeholders. After receiving two such reports, Sue, the project sponsor, informs Tim she would like to have reports every two weeks only. Tim did an analysis of communications requirements and considered various attributes for the communications management plan. What aspect has he missed, which resulted in a daily status report being sent instead of two-week status reports?

A. He has not considered the frequency of information distribution.
B. He has not considered the purpose for distribution of information.
C. He has not considered the project's timeline.
D. He has not considered the content of the information.
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Tim has most likely not considered the frequency of distribution of the information. He should have analyzed the stakeholder requirements and planned for distribution of the status reports accordingly. It is unlikely that on an 18-month project, the project sponsor would want to receive daily status reports. (Perhaps only near the end of the project, with just a few days or weeks to go, the project sponsor might request daily reports to monitor the project closely or to deal with certain issues.) Hence, Tim should have considered stakeholder requirements and planned the frequency of the status reports accordingly. The remaining choices are incorrect. The choice that Tim has not considered the timeline of the project may be one of the factors that influence the frequency of information distribution, but is not a complete response by itself.

Q36A project was estimated to cost $100,000 with a timeline of five months. Due to some unusual causes, the schedule was delayed. At the end of the third month, the project manager reviews the project and finds that the project is 40 percent complete and Actual Costs are $60,000. Assuming that the cost variations observed to date would not continue going forward, the Estimate to Complete (ETC) for the project are:

A. 40000
B. 120000
C. 90000
D. 60000
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The budget at completion (BAC) = $100,000 (given). The Actual Cost (AC) = $60,000 (given). The Earned value (EV) = (40/100)*100,000 since 40% of the project is complete. Hence, Earned Value (EV) = $40,000.
This is an instance of an atypical cause of variance in the project. The formula for estimate to complete (ETC) is: ETC = BAC - EV = 100,000 - 40,000 = 60,000. [PMBOK 6th Edition, Page 267]

Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
This is an example of avoidance. It involves changing the project management plan to "eliminate" the threat posed by an adverse risk, isolating the project objectives from the risk's impacts, or relaxing the objective that is in jeopardy, such as by extending the schedule or reducing scope. Transference involves shifting the negative impact of a threat along with the ownership of the response. Mitigation implies a reduction in the probability and impact of an adverse risk. Postponement is not a valid strategy since it does not address the risk. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 443] [Project Risk Management]
