C. To ensure timely closure of the project
D. Preventing scope creep
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The main reason for controlling the project scope is to deal with the impact of changes on the project. This is done by managing approved changes and disregarding rejected changes. This reduces the risk of scope creep on the project. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 168] [Project Scope Management]

Q43A project manager is trying to budget time for the various processes in the Project Schedule Management Knowledge Area. As project activities are performed, in which of these processes will the majority of effort occur?

A. Control Schedule
B. Estimate Activity Durations
C. Define Activities
D. Develop Schedule
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Project Schedule Management has five planning processes and one monitoring and controlling process. As project activities are being performed (the project is in execution), the majority of effort in the Project Schedule Management Knowledge Area will occur in the Control Schedule process to ensure completion of project work in a timely manner.

Q44Which strategy attempts to reduce the probability and the impact of a risk to the point where the risk is acceptable?

A. Mitigation
B. Avoidance
C. Acceptance
D. Transfer
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Risk mitigation is a strategy that seeks to reduce the risk to a level that the risk becomes acceptable. A Project Manager may add specific project tasks to the work of a project to reduce the level of risk. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 443] [Project Risk Management]

Q45You are a project manager for Groceries 'R' Us, a supermarket chain, and are currently working on a project to build a new outlet. The planned values (PV) for the foundation and the frame were $150,000 and $500,000. After five months, you do a performance measurement analysis. You are currently not ahead of schedule. The actual costs for the foundation and frame were $175,000 and $650,000. At this point, 100 percent of the foundation is complete, and only 80 percent of the frame is complete. Which value represents the cost performance index (CPI) to two decimal places at this point in the project?

A. 0.84
B. 1.5
C. 0.67
D. 1.19
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
We calculate the total actual cost by adding the $175,000 and $650,000 for the foundation and frame. The total actual cost is $825,000. Now we calculate earned value (EV). We need to identify all of the activities that have been completed or partially completed as of the measurement date. If partially completed, we calculate the fractional value of the budgeted cost for the activity by the percent completed. Add up the budgeted costs for completed or partially completed work activities including any work that has been performed ahead of schedule. We are told that we are not ahead of schedule, so there is no budgeted cost to include for that. 100% of the foundation is complete, and only 80% of the frame is complete. Therefore, we add 100% of $150,000 and 80% of 500,000 (which is $400,000) to get a total EV of $550,000. Now find the CPI by dividing the total EV by the total actual cost for the same time period. The result for CPI is $550,000/$825,000 or 0.67. [PMBOK 6th edition]

Q46A project manager prepared quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete a project and produced activity cost estimates. He or she also prepared some supporting detail for these estimates. Which of the following would not be a supporting detail for cost estimates?

A. Indication of the range of possible estimates (ex: $5,000 +/- 5%)
B. Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate (ex: 90 percent )
C. Documentation of the basis of the estimates
D. Indication of the profit margin that can be expected on the project Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Indication of the profit margin that can be achieved on the project is not a supporting detail for cost estimates. The focus of the Estimate Costs process is to perform a quantitative assessment of all costs that are probably required to accomplish the project work. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 247]

Q47A project manager is estimating activity durations for a project. Which of the following should he or she consider while performing this activity?

A. While calculating the duration of schedule activities, differences in the capabilities of staff assigned should not be taken into consideration. All senior and junior staff should be given equal weight.
B. While calculating the duration of schedule activities, differences in staff capabilities should be taken into consideration. A senior staff member will generally be expected to finish an activity in 80 percent of the time that a junior member.
C. While calculating the duration of schedule activities, differences in staff capabilities should be taken into consideration. A senior staff member will generally be expected to finish an activity in less time than a junior member.
D. While calculating the duration of schedule activities, an average should be used and the actual differences in the capabilities of staff assigned should not be taken into consideration.
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
When calculating the duration of schedule activities, differences in the capabilities of assigned staff should be taken into consideration. Hence, a senior staff member will typically be expected to finish an activity in less time than a junior member. There is no generic rule that a senior resource can finish an activity in 80% of the time that a junior resource could. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 196]

Q49Which technique is NOT commonly used to align the timing of activities with available resources?

A. Critical Path Method
B. Resource Leveling
C. Resource optimization
D. Resource Smoothing
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The critical path method is not a technique commonly used to align the timing of activities with available resources. The critical path method is a technique used to establish a rough timeline fitting the project's work activities within the deadlines defined in the scope statement.
