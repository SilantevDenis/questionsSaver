Q1You are an electrical engineer with extensive experience in managing transmission projects but limited experience with electronic design projects. However, in a stretch assignment, you were recently transferred to another department in your company that focuses on electronic design. Furthermore, you were asked to lead a highly important project involving both transmission and electronic design. In preparation for a meeting with your manager to discuss this opportunity, you review the initial project design brief. Due to your limited background in electronic design, a number of items in this document seem unclear to you. When you arrive at your meeting, your manager asks if you will be leading the project. How do you respond?

A. Accept the project and tell your manager that your expertise in transmission makes you an ideal manager for this project.
B. Decline the project, citing your lack of experience in electronics design.
C. Accept the project, but do not discuss your qualifications or lack thereof.
D. State that you would like to lead the project, but you must disclose that your primary domain of expertise is transmission, and that you may need supplementary training in electronics design.
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
State that you would like to lead the project, but disclose that your expertise is in transmission, not electronics design. PMI's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct mandates that project managers accept only those projects for which they have appropriate qualifications and experience. However, if project stakeholders are fully informed of the areas where you may be lacking skills or knowledge, and they still wish you to lead the project, this is not a violation of the code.

Q2A seller began a project that was contracted on a time-and-materials (T&M) basis. Based on the agreed- upon rates and effort, the initial contract amount was $100,000 over a one-year period. However, when the project was completed, the total contract value turned out to be $350,000 over a two-year period. What mechanism could the buyer have used to prevent this unlimited cost growth and schedule change?

A. Use of a not-to-exceed value and a time limit on the contract
B. A service level agreement
C. A penalty based on the increased cost and timeline
D. Use of a fixed price contract
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Use of not-to-exceed values and time limits on T & M contracts help prevent unlimited cost growth or schedule changes. A fixed-price contract is an option, but whether to choose that option is a decision to be made prior to awarding the project and signing the contract.

Q3The Budget at Completion (BAC) for a project is $50,000. The Actual Costs (AC) to date are $10,000. The Earned Value (EV) is $7,000. At this stage, the project management team did a manual bottom-up summation of costs and forecast an Estimate to Complete (ETC) of $50,000. What is the Estimate at Completion (EAC) for the project?

A. $57,000
B. $40,000
C. $60,000
D. $53,000
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
When a bottom-up manual forecasting has been done for the ETC, the calculation for EAC is EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC. Hence, EAC = 10,000 + 50,000 = $60,000. Note that the BAC is no longer viable at this stage. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 267] [Project Cost Management]

Q4Projects, portfolios, and programs are different entities in an organization. Which of the following choices states a correct relationship between them?

A. A portfolio consists of a collection of projects or programs that are grouped together to achieve strategic business objectives. The projects or programs need not be directly related.
B. A project is a collection of programs and portfolios that are grouped together to achieve the project objectives.
C. A program consists of a collection of projects or portfolios that are grouped together to achieve strategic business objectives.
D. A program is a collection of projects that are grouped together for convenience. It may include unrelated work if the work is under the same business division.
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
A portfolio is a collection of projects or programs that are grouped together to achieve a strategic business objective. Portfolio management focuses on ensuring that projects and programs are reviewed to prioritize resource allocation and that the management of the portfolio is aligned with organizational strategies. The projects or programs need not be directly related. A program is a collection of projects with common objectives, so unrelated work cannot be grouped together under a program.

What should Carole do?

A. Do not spend more time on identifying the non-key stakeholders
B. Seek expert judgment from the identified key stakeholders
C. Request that the project sponsor provide the details of the remaining stakeholders
D. Carry out a stakeholder analysis with the identified key stakeholders Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The project manager is responsible for stakeholder identification; this cannot be delegated to the project sponsor. Identifying and analyzing the key stakeholders is not enough to ensure the success of the project.
Other project stakeholders can be identified by interviewing the stakeholders who are already identified.

Q6Janice, a project manager, wanted to obtain early feedback on the project requirements. However, she was concerned that the abstract representations of the requirements might not elicit useful feedback. Which of the following tools and techniques might help her overcome this hurdle?

A. Histograms
B. Prototypes
C. Ishikawa diagram
D. Control charts
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Prototypes are working models of the expected product before actually building it. The tangible nature of prototypes allows stakeholders to experiment with a model of their final product early in the project life cycle and to generate clear feedback. The other choices are incorrect as they are quality management tools.

Q7You are the project manager of a project and are about to conduct a risk identification exercise in a few days' time. You want to remind the participants in the exercise beforehand of the various sources from which risk may arise in the project. What could you use to help you do this?

A. A Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)
B. A Risk Simulation Structure (RSS)
C. A Risk Register
D. An Impact Matrix
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) is a hierarchically organized depiction of identified project risks arranged by risk category and subcategory. This may be based on a previously prepared categorization framework. The RBS serves to remind participants in the risk identification exercise of the different sources from which project risk may arise. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 405] [Project Risk Management]

Q8Ron is a project manager handling an alternate water-supply project. During a project performance review, he notices the following: (i) Activity A, on the critical path, is delayed by four days. (ii) Activity B, not on the critical path, is delayed by nine days. (iii) Activity C, on the critical path, is delayed by two days. (iv) Activity D, not on the critical path, is delayed by five days. In what sequence should Ron prioritize his efforts in addressing these delays?

A. First Activities A and B, and then Activities C and D
B. First Activities A and C, and then Activities B and D
C. First Activities C and D, and then Activities A and B
D. First Activities A and D, and then Activities B and C
Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
An important part of schedule control is deciding if schedule variation requires corrective action. Activities on the critical path get first priority for immediate action. Larger delays on activities not on the critical path may not require immediate attention since they may not affect the overall project schedule. Hence, Ron will first deal with the delays on the critical path and then tackle the delays on the other paths. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 210] [Project Schedule Management]

Q16You have just joined a new organization as a project manager. You have heard a number of rumors about the procurement manager having possible underhanded dealings with suppliers. However, you have no proof these rumors are true. Your project requires a large number of dump trucks. Company policy mandates that all purchases go through the procurement department rather than the department employees. The value of the dump truck purchase is US$395,000, and the contract went to a supplier your company regularly uses.

Q20You have just completed a solid waste management project in an underdeveloped country. The contractor you are working for has a strict policy of abiding by local laws and rules although the local resources working on the project have a much more lax approach to following laws and policies. Now at the end of the project, you are handing over the operational equipment to the local operators and disposing of the leftover inventory and other materials that were used during the project. More than 50 percent of the toxic materials used during the project remains in your inventory. There is no law that would prohibit you from disposing of either the type or quantity of remaining materials in the local sewage system. What should you do?

A. Give the material to local resources to dispose of by selling it to a recycling facility
B. Do not dispose of the materials improperly
C. Dispose of the material in the local sewage system; there is no law applicable here

A. Refuse to do what your company management asks you to do since it violates the code of ethics and professionalism.
B. Do what your management asks you to do. Your loyalty needs to be with your company. As long as management has the confidence you can do the project, you can go with the plan.
C. Do what your management asks you to do, but inform them that you do not want to be associated with the project since it violates the code of ethics and professionalism.
D. Explain the gaps to your management clearly and also explain that this will be a stretch assignment. You can further explain to them that it is best to reveal to the potential buyer that your company does not possess the necessary skills but that you are confident of ramping up the necessary skills and delivering the project successfully, based on your company's track record.
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Since you are aware that your company lacks the necessary skills, you need to be truthful while bidding.
Rather than outright refusing to do what your company management asks you to do, you should explain the reasons to them and ensure that all stakeholders involved are aware that this will be a stretch assignment.
However, also explain to your management that it is best to tell the potential buyer that you and your company are willing to put in the necessary effort to make the project a success. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q25Eric, a project manager, is a certified PMP. He is responding to an RFP from a buyer and needs to fill in details on his company's financial performance. His company has performed poorly during the current quarter, and the results will be published in two to three days. However, the company has done very well in the previous quarters. The RFP is due in 10 days, and all the information in the RFP is complete except the financial information. What should Eric do?

A. Eric should fill in the information for the previous quarter and ignore the current quarter. This is an aberration, and the company will eventually come out of the bad patch.
B. Eric should present the previous quarter's results as the latest results. This will give his company a better chance to win the project.
C. Eric should fill in the financial information for the previous quarter and send out the RFP response before the current quarter results are published.
D. Eric should wait until the current results are out and update the latest financial information before sending out the RFP response.
Correct Answer: D
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
As a PMP, Eric must not behave in a manner that will mislead the buyer. Hence, given that there are still a sufficient number of days remaining before the RFP is due, it is his responsibility to wait for the current quarter results to be published and truthfully provide this information in the RFP.

Q26You are managing a project with more than 130 procurement contracts. Because of the number of contracts, your project team includes a procurement manager and a procurement assistant. Company policy requires that certain types of procurements be advertised to potential bidders by means of newspaper advertisements. The procurement assistant typically reviews the bids received and shortlists the suppliers for further review by the procurement team. During a meeting to review and select a vendor from the shortlisted suppliers, you discover that one of the suppliers is a company your cousin owns. Which of the following is your best course of action?

A. Because the procurement assistant prepared the short list, not you, you do not need disclose your relationship with the supplier and may continue to participate in the selection process
B. Disclose your relationship with the provider and continue to participate in the selection process
C. Ask the procurement manager to lead the vendor selection process for this contract and excuse yourself from the review
D. Remove the supplier from the short list
Correct Answer: C
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The best choice is asking the procurement manager to lead the selection process and excusing yourself from the review. According to the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, project managers must disclose any potential conflict of interest situation to the appropriate stakeholders, who will determine if it is appropriate for the project manager to continue participating in the affected processes. Project managers must also act fairly towards others; removing the supplier from the list because of a possible conflict of interest on the part of the project manager is unfair to the vendor.

Q35You are managing an electronic chip design project for a customer. There are a number of engineers and subject matter experts from the customer's organization that have been assigned as resources to the project plus several additional design engineers that your company has supplied. All the engineers were involved in the development of a prototype chip, an extremely time-consuming and expensive process. Upon the completion of the prototype, you submit it for review to ensure there are no patent infringement issues with the design. However, the review determines there are several issues that could result in an intellectual property dispute with the patent owners should the prototype design be released commercially. Resources from your company developed the affected prototype elements, as well as from your customer's organization. What should you do?

A. Ask the engineers to revise the design and resubmit it
B. Notify the project stakeholders immediately
C. Request permission to use the copyright material
D. Submit the prototype as is since the budget and schedule do not accommodate rework Correct Answer: B
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Notifying the project stakeholders immediately is the best choice. Unauthorized use of the intellectual property of others is unethical and is prohibited by the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Once the project stakeholders are notified of the situation, a plan forward can be developed. This plan could involve licensing the previously patented technology from the patent owner or reworking the design.
However, this mitigation plan must involve input from the appropriate project stakeholders. [PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct] [Prof. Responsibility]

Q46A project manager has decided to use a decision tree to do a build or upgrade analysis. The build requires an investment of $200M. On the build decision branch, there is a 60 percent probability of strong demand (yielding a revenue of $400M) and a 40 percent probability of weak demand (yielding a revenue of $150M).
What is the expected monetary value (EMV) of the build?

A. $100M
B. $300M
C. $140M
D. $200M
Correct Answer: A
Section: (none)
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
The payoff for the strong demand scenario is $400M - $200M = $200M (since the initial investment is $200M). The payoff for the weak demand scenario is $150M - $200M = - $50M. Therefore, the EMV is computed as: (0.6 * 200) + (0.4 * -50), where 0.6 represents the 60% probability of the strong demand scenario and 0.4 represents the 40% probability of the weak demand scenario. 120 - 20 = 100. Therefore, the expected monetary value is $100M. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 435] [Project Risk Management]
